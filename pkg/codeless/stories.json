No loop may\nbe truly infinite.  Someday the power will fail, the server\nwill rust, the temple will crumble, and the sun will\nswallow the earth.”\n\nAsked the abbot, “What of the dark fat one, who believes\nthat the loop is infinite?”\n\n“Give him two skins of wine, for he is wiser.  To the user\nwaiting at his browser, ten seconds is agony, a minute is an\naeon, and anything longer is effectively an eternity.

How, then, may we achieve perfection?”\n\n“Through practice,” said one monk.\n\n“Through diligent study,” said another.\n\n“Through the appeasement of the proper gods,” said a third.\n\nAn old white-bearded monk, who had been sitting quietly in\nthe corner, raised his head:\n\n“I know how perfection may be achieved,” he said.  “But I\nfear that all who hear my answer will be forever unconvinced\nof its truth unless I speak exactly the right words, with\nthe most pleasing of intonations, at the most propitious\ntime of day.

  "Title": "Power",
  "Text": "It is the function of the Temple abbots to direct the\nactivities of their respective clans: choosing projects,\nsetting deadlines, apportioning tasks, and employing\nwhatever means are necessary to ensure that schedules are\nmet.  It is for these powers that the abbots are both envied\nand despised.  Indeed, it is rare for abbot and monk to\ncross paths without the latter finding himself more\nmiserable for the experience.\n\nThus it was with no great joy that the elder monk\nShinpuru found himself visited by the new head abbot of\nthe Spider Clan.\n\n\n\nShinpuru was in the temple greenhouse, tending the plants of\na small winter garden that he kept as a hobby, when the\nhead abbot approached and bowed low, saying: “Have I the good\nfortune of being in the presence of the monk Shinpuru, whose\ncode is admired throughout the Temple?”\n\n“This miserable soul is he,” said Shinpuru, returning the bow.\n\n“I have come to ask if you have given any thought to the\nfuture,” said the abbot.\n\n“Tomorrow I expect the sun shall rise,” answered Shinpuru.\n“Unless I am wrong, in which case it will not.”\n\n“I was thinking of your future, specifically,” replied the\nabbot.\n\n“If the sun does not rise, my future will be the least of my\nconcerns,” said Shinpuru.  “If it does rise, then I expect\nto greet it while enjoying a small bowl of rice and eel.\nUnless I am wrong, in which case I will not.”\n\nThe abbot smiled.  “It is true then, that the monk Shinpuru\nplans for all contingencies.  This is also why I have come.\nOf late there has been a shortage of abbots in the\nSpider Clan.*  The Temple wishes to bestow upon you\nthe honor of promotion into our ranks.”\n\n“I am humbled,” said Shinpuru, bowing again.\n\n“The work is difficult,” continued the abbot.  “Our day\nbegins well before sunrise, which you would seldom be able\nto greet at your leisure, for there are many meetings to\nattend and we run with our bowls from one to another.\nLikewise you will not often see the sunset, except perhaps\non a webcam.  In exchange for this you will receive far\ngreater compensation from the Temple coffers, and the power\nto direct the activities of the Temple itself.”\n\n“And what will become of ‘Shinpuru, whose code is admired\nthroughout the Temple,’ when he no longer codes?”\nasked the monk.\n\n“Fear not!” said the abbot. “You will do what you have\nexcelled at, only one level higher: Meta-Coding, if you\nwill.  Instead of design documents we produce long-term\nplans; instead of software we churn out schedules; instead\nof defects and features we speak of costs and benefits.  The\nTemple itself is the machine we practice our arts upon,\nrefactoring it as we see fit.”\n\n“A most worthy cause,” said Shinpuru, returning his\nattention to his vines.  “I, too, have noticed the shortage\nof abbots.  Such is the price of power.  For as the\nseafaring matriarch Subashikoi once observed, the monks\nmay command the rigging and the masters may command the\nmonks, but it is the abbots who chart the course and hold\nthe tiller; so it is the abbots who are consigned to the\ndeep when the ship founders—oftimes by their own crew.”\n\n“Only fools meet such a fate,” said the abbot.  “And the\nmonk Shinpuru is no fool.  Unless I am wrong, but I am\nseldom wrong about such things.”\n\n“Then you will not think me a fool for declining the\nTemple’s generous offer,” said Shinpuru, pruning a few\nyellow leaves.\n\nThe head abbot frowned.  “What would Shinpuru think of a\nseed that refused to sprout, or a tree that refused to yield\nfruit?  What else should I think of a monk who so quickly\ndeclines an opportunity for growth, for command, for power?”\n\nShinpuru set aside his shears to tie up the vine.  “Define\npower,” he said.\n\n“The ability to do as one wishes,” said the abbot.\n\n“Well, then,” said Shinpuru.  “Tomorrow I wish to greet the\nsunrise with my little bowl.  Then I wish to take some hot\ntea at my workstation as I read the technical sites I find\nmost illuminating, after which I look forward to a fruitful\nday of coding interrupted only by some pleasant exchanges\nwith my fellows and a midday meal at this very spot, tending\nmy garden.  When night falls I wish to find myself in my\ncozy room with a belly full of rice, a cup full of hot sake,\na purse full of coins sufficient to buy more seeds, and a\nmind empty of all other cares.”\n\nThe abbot bowed.  “I expect that Shinpuru has all the power\nhe could desire, then.  Unless he is wrong.”\n\n“I am seldom wrong about such things,” said Shinpuru,\npicking up his shears again as another yellow leaf caught\nhis eye.  “In a world where even the sunrise is uncertain, a\nman may be excused for not knowing a great many things.  But\nto not know my own heart?  I hope to never be so hopeless\na fool.”\n\n\n* As documented in cases 61, 62, 67, 120, and probably others besides.  Abbots in the Spider Clan have the average life expectancy of a dolphin in the Gobi desert."

There were several competing\nimplementations of a particular Data Access Object; at\npresent he was attempting to decide which would become the\ndefinitive one that his clan would adopt.\n\n“Each implementation has its own particular virtues and\nvexations,” said the monk to the Java master.  “And each has\nfeatures the others lack.

If you fill your cup from the temple well, no gong\nsounds but the bucket is heavy.

The temple well I have drunk from in the\npast: its waters are bitter with limestone.  And though I am\nnot acquainted with the water-seller, I heard his gong many\ntimes today.  On this evidence, I would choose the cup from\nthe water-seller.”\n\n“A most sensible conclusion,” said the master.  “Indeed, I\nhave visited this same water-seller every morning for eight\nyears, and found the experience perfectly satisfying each\ntime.  Which is the vessel that he filled?”\n\nThe master sipped from the indicated cup, and his face fell\nin disappointment.  “Young brother,” he said.  “You have\ncompletely misunderstood my thirst.  Where is the sound of\nthe gong?”\n\n\n\nThe master’s thirst is unsatisfied \nyet the monk has his answer—\nwhat sound was the vessel that poured it? \n\nThe monk would have fared better \nif he had set a brass censer on the window-ledge \nand merely waited for rain."

An examination\nof the data shows that it contains two unique values: zero\nand one.  I presume that the zero indicates falsehood, and\nthe one, truth.”\n\nSaid the master: “Only an initiate can say what is counted\nby these numbers.”\n\nSaid the God of the Silence Between Words: “The presence of\na single zero implies the existence of a one to count it,\nand then a two to count both, and likewise to infinity.  Did\nthe universe spring thusly from the shell of a serpent’s egg?”\n\n\n\nThe nun raised the first two fingers on her right hand.  “I\nhave considered storing a two in some random row, merely to\nobserve the effect on the application.”\n\nSaid the master: “You seek to determine whether truth is\nregarded as the presence of a one, or the absence of a zero.”\n\nSaid the God of the Silence Between Words: “The absence of a\nzero implies a presence.  The presence of a zero\nimplies an absence.  When the serpent devours its tail\nup to the tip of its tongue, then what remains?”\n\n\n\nThe nun pressed her index finger to her chin.  “The column\nalso allows nulls.  If the column asks a question,\nconvention dictates that a null represents an unknown\nanswer.”\n\nSaid the master: “This null is either the shrewd pause that\nprecedes a lie, or the gentle hush before the revelation of\ntruth.  Its quality rests entirely in what it will become.\nOnly when it ceases to exist may we understand what it was.”\n\nSaid the God of the Silence Between Words: “The ghost\nborrows the form of the departed.  Yet what shape may we\nassign the spirit of the yet-unborn?”\n\n\n\nThe nun steepled her fingers.  “Before the application\nqueries the database, the value of this column is unknown.\nAfterwards, any null in this column will be represented\nintentionally as a null Boolean.  The value is then\nsimultaneously known and unknown.”\n\nSaid the master: “We have learned only that we have learned\nnothing, yet this is the root of wisdom.”\n\nSaid the God of the Silence Between Words: “The sage and the\nfool go to their graves alike in this respect: both believe the\nsage to be a fool.  Where, then, may wisdom be found?”\n\n\n\nThe nun folded her hands in her lap.  “The null SQL integer,\npersisted, becomes the null Boolean in fleeting memory.  Two\nnothings, of wholly different natures.  How can absences be\ninequal?”\n\nThe master nodded.\n\nThe God of the Silence Between Words raised an eyebrow.\n\n\n* Probably Kaimu."

The following night the answer will be the same,\nand will conclude with the same order to return,\nuntil the novice is enlightened.\n\nThe annals tell us this:\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Venerable Jinyu was a nun of but five and twenty\nyears, she and a monk of equal age were approached by\nthe abbot of their clan.\n\n“The Emperor will be coming to inspect the new VAX\nmainframe, and to choose worthy members for various Royal\nCommittees,” said the abbot. “Thus we wish His Excellency to\nbe impressed with all facets of our temple.  The koi ponds\nare lifeless and choked with weeds.  Each of you must take\none pond, clean it well, and ensure that new fish are\npresent each morning for the Emperor’s amusement.”\n\nThe monk was given the North Pond.  The stagnant green water\nwas unsuitable for any living thing, so with a yoke and\nbuckets the monk hauled every last drop away.  Then he\nscrubbed the lichen from the stones, pulled the weeds, and\nbrought bucket after bucket of clean water from the temple\nwell.  After a week the little pool was teeming with red\nand gold carp, bought from the markets with the monk’s own\ncoins.\n\nMeanwhile, the South Pond lay untouched, and young Jinyu was\nnowhere to be found.\n\nWith the Emperor’s visit fast approaching, the abbot sent\nfor the nun.  When Jinyu was brought before him, he boxed\nher ears.  “If the Emperor loses confidence in our temple,\nour IT services contract may not be the only thing cut off\nprematurely.”\n\nJinyu bowed.  “All will be as ordained, in two days’ time.”\n\nThe following day the abbot went to the North Pond, which\nnow was flush with white and black carp—again, purchased\nby the monk from the markets in town.  Yet the South Pond’s\nstate was exactly as before.  He found Jinyu resting under a\ncypress tree, and boxed her ears again.\n\nAgain Jinyu bowed.  “All will be as ordained, tomorrow morning.”\n\nThe following day, the abbot went once more to the North\nPond, which now was bursting with striped and spotted carp.\nYet the South Pond’s state was worse than before: the\nlovely garden circling it had been dug up, and standing in\nthe midst of the ruin was Jinyu and her shovel.\n\nThe abbot boxed Jinyu’s ears.  “Account for yourself!” he\ndemanded.\n\nThe nun said nothing, but turned her shovel in a clot\nof earth at the edge of the pond.  Behind it was a trench\nthat Jinyu had dug all the way to the river below the\ntemple.  With the clot gone, the stagnant water\nspilled out of the pond and vanished down the trench.\n\nThen Jinyu turned her shovel at the other end of the pond,\nrevealing a trench which carried down the waters of\na mountain stream.  The stream rushed into the pond and\nout the other side, cleaning the stones and sweeping away\nthe dead weeds.  In the dark water, flashes of red\nand gold could be seen.\n\n\n\nThus was Jinyu chosen to head the Exalted Subcommittee on\nAutomated Testing.\n\nAnd if anyone would dispute this account, let him first seek\nout Java master Bawan, and ask the ritual question."

The logic is distributed among multiple\napplications, each implemented with wildly different\ntechnologies.  Instead of creating common utilities the\nauthors have merely copied swaths of code from place to\nplace, often introducing subtle differences afterward.\nBackground jobs seek and modify database records for no\ndocumented reason, and the database itself conspires against\nme: a simple update of one table can trigger a cascade of\ninserts and deletes in others.”\n\n\n\n\n“I see two paths before you,” said the Java master.  “In the\nfirst, you make only the necessary additions and quickly\nproclaim victory.  In the second, you begin the arduous task\nof refactoring the code base.  How will you proceed?”\n\nThe monk bowed in shame.  “I cannot say.  At present I am\nafraid to touch anything, lest my ignorance prove my\nundoing.”\n\n“Fear makes good armor but a poor blade,” nodded the Java\nmaster.  “To defeat your fear, we must dispel your\nignorance.”  With his staff he slid the window-screen open\nand gestured to the forest beyond.\n\n“Follow the Road of White Nettles for three days into the\nmountains, and you will come to a hermitage perched on a\ncliff.  A learned brother dwells there who keeps copies of\nour client’s documentation.  He will advise you on the\ndesign of the system.”\n\n\n\n\nThe monk did as he was told, and at sunset came to the\nhermitage, which was a building unlike any he had ever seen.\n\nIt had clearly begun life as a sturdy stone house at the\nvery edge of the cliff, but three new wings of rough-hewn\npine with bark shingles now thrust well beyond the cliff and\ninto space.  Beyond these were open walkways and stairways,\nending in dozens of rooms perched on diagonal stilts that\nwere (only barely) supported by rocky outcroppings far\nbelow.\n\nLashed onto the rooms were other additions stretching still\nfurther out into the void, made of bamboo and canted crazily\nin all directions.  Ramps and ladders erupted from their\nundersides, leading to isolated rooms suspended by ropes and\nmade chiefly of reed and straw.  Everything was bound\ntogether with lines of hemp, tied off at a windowsill here\nand a weathervane there, as though some great drunken spider\nhad caught a hundred huts in its web.  The structure swayed\nsickeningly in the gentle breeze, creaking as it did.\n\n\n\n\nThe monk stood gaping for a while, then recovered himself\nand struck the gong.\n\nFrom the furthest room came the hermit, shimmying up ropes\nand down rooftops, disappearing into a trapdoor of bamboo\nand finally reappearing at the door of the hut.\n\n“What news to me from the temple?” asked the hermit.\n“Have I been summoned home at last?”\n\nThe monk indicated that he had no such news to relay.\n\nThe hermit hung his head.  “Miserable me!  For until such\nword is given, my task is to expand this hermitage ever\noutward beyond the cliff’s edge, to house the temple’s\ngrowing collection of temporary files.  This I have done for\nyears now, faithfully and unquestioningly, hoping to one day\nearn the master’s favor and return from exile.  But I\nconfess that my work becomes more difficult with each\npassing season.  Winter snows hang so heavy on the rooftops\nthat the bamboo stilts begin to buckle, and in summer I must\nfight the magpies to keep my straw walls from becoming part of\nsomeone’s nest.  By the by... you are not (I hope) possessed\nof any allergies?  Pollen?  Ragweed?  I once watched seven\nrooms collapse and tumble down the cliff in answer to a\nvigorous sneeze...”\n\n\n\n\n“But this is madness!” cried the monk.  “Now that you have\nsome sense of how many rooms are needed, can you not tear\ndown this monstrosity and start anew?”\n\n“What nonsense.  Imagine the time such an endeavor might\ntake, and how displeased my master might become in the\nmeanwhile!  How could I justify subtracting storerooms\ninstead of adding them?  My exile might be extended for\nanother decade!  No, it is far safer to do exactly as I have\nbeen commanded.  Anyway, I understand this hermitage quite\nwell, its strong places and weak ones; and so long as I\ntread lightly and avoid pepper, my odds of perishing in a\nlong fall are reasonably low.\n\n“But enough of my plight, learned brother.  If you were not\nsent here to summon me home, then you must need my help\nunderstanding the Imperial Shoemaker’s order-processing\nsystem.  Many like yourself have come for that purpose, for\nit was I who was its author.”\n\nThe monk only bowed and departed back down the road, having\nalready obtained the promised enlightenment from the\nhermitage."

The client agreed, and the contract was awarded to\nthe Sparrow Clan.  Old Jinyu sent her congratulations:\n\n    Soaring alone over distant fields, \n    Sparrow nabs the worm \n    while her flock still slumbers.\n\nThe system was delivered, and enjoyed great success.\n\n\n\n\nMonths passed.  Many came to use the application, including\ndevelopers who were intrigued and inspired by its novel use\nof the Cloud.  Although they did not possess the Sparrow\nClan’s software, the fundamental approach was easy to\ndiscern.\n\nWord reached the abbess that a Birds of a Feather session\nhad convened at a recent conference, and the attendees had\nbegun work on a standard API for this new type of Cloud\ninterface.  The next day the head monk opened his mail to\nfind this warning:\n\n   Yellow leaves tumble through the air. \n   The flock is stirring.\n\nThe Sparrow Clan had no interest in the new API, which it\nregarded as over-engineered.  They continued to employ\nand develop their own approach with each new contract won.\nYet cryptic notes continued to arrive:\n\n   A hundred sparrows can peck an eagle blind.\n\n   Every nightingale loves her own song best.\n\n   One bird cannot hatch an egg.\n\nThe Sparrow Clan’s software continued to evolve,\naccumulating some impressive new features, but as a\nconsequence it was now hopelessly incompatible with the new\nAPI specification.  The head monk had no concerns (Let\nthe other temples enjoy their primitive\nimplementations!) but still he dreaded opening his mail\neach morning.  Jinyu’s tone grew ever darker:\n\n   The grown falcon does not dine on flies.\n\n\n\n\nTemples which had adopted the new API continued to\ncollaborate, producing various extensions and enhancements.\nCommercial ventures were spun off, competition escalated,\nand soon a blizzard of glossy brochures were printed up and\ndispatched by carrier pigeon to all corners of the Empire.\nEven the abbess received a few, which she forwarded on\nwith this note:\n\n   A little fledgeling sang thus to me: \n   snow has fallen.\n\nAcross the Empire, governors and generals clamored for\nsystems built with the newer technology.  Every temple in\nthe bidding crowed that its solution was\nstandards-compliant—or rather, every temple but one.\n\nIn a secluded courtyard of the Temple of the Morning Brass\nGong, a meeting was held to discuss the fate of the Sparrow\nClan.

Those who\nhesitated were given a swift rap on the head with the\nmaster’s staff, after which they were to remain silent for\nthe rest of the day—assuming, of course, that they had\nnot been knocked unconscious by the blow.\n\nThe young monk asked one of the brothers, “Why does Bawan\npunish those who delay in their answers?”\n\n“Because he believes them to be thinking,” said the elder\nmonk.  He indicated a row of skulls set on a ledge above the\nmaster’s door.  Some were dull and dusty while others\nappeared to be freshly-parted from their previous owners,\nbut carved into the forehead of each were the words DON’T\nTHINK in the master’s unmistakable script.\n\nThe elder monk departed, leaving the younger to ponder\nBawan’s algorithm.\n\n\n\nSome time later these same two monks were working furiously\nthrough the night to upgrade one of the clan’s venerable\ndocument databases.  Critical systems were offlined while\nthe old documents were migrated to the new servers.\n\nThe conversion script ran for hours, yet failed near the\nend due to a minor problem.  A second run was started, but\nsince dawn was fast approaching the monks specified that any\ndocuments which had already been written by the first run\nshould be skipped.\n\nAs the second run sped through the portion of the database\nthat the first already processed, Bawan noticed something\ncurious.  Many thousands of status messages scrolled past\nwhich looked like this:\n\n   document 2677091: skipped (already exists)\n   document 2677092: skipped (already exists)\n   document 2677093: skipped (already exists)\n\n\nYet once in a while one would appear which looked like this:\n\n   document 2677094: skipped (already exists) (** source is newer)\n\n\n“Why the difference?” demanded Bawan.\n\n“I cannot say,” said the elder monk quickly.\nBawan snorted and struck the man’s cheek with the back of\nhis hand.  Then he turned to the younger monk.\n\n“Why the difference?” he repeated.\n\nIn that instant—his mind racing between thoughts of the\nmaster’s hand and the master’s staff—the young monk\nreceived a flash of insight.\n\n“Clock skew,” declared the young monk.  “When we pull a\nsource document from the old server we preserve its\nmodification time, and then we create the target document.\nYet if the system clocks disagree, the script will\nsometimes believe that the source is newer than the\ntarget.”\n\nThe master indeed found a small time discrepancy between the\ntwo servers.  He nodded approvingly and departed, leaving\nthe young monk to bask in the satisfaction of having\nunderstood Bawan’s algorithm.\n\n\n\nOne day later Bawan ordered the clan to assemble outside his\noffice.  As all waited for the master to appear, the elder monk\nwhispered that Bawan had spent the whole day assembling definitive\nevidence that clock skew was responsible for the odd messages.\n\n“What did he find?” asked a nun.\n\n“Nothing of the sort,” said the elder monk. “In truth, one\nserver had accidentally been left running during the\nmigration, so users were still making edits in the old\ndatabase.  The second conversion skipped these documents\nwith the observed warning.  When traffic was diverted to the\nnew database, subsequent user edits made restoration of\nthe lost edits impossible.  It will be a great\nembarrassment for the clan.”\n\nThe discussion halted abruptly as Bawan emerged from his\noffice with a ladder, which he then ascended to place a\nglistening new skull on the ledge above his door.  The\nskull’s features recalled those of the young monk, who had\nnot been seen all day.  As before, the words DON’T THINK\nwere inscribed on the forehead.  And on the jawbone—invisible to anyone standing below the ledge but quite\nlegible as the master carried it up—was the single word,\nKNOW."

But Hwídah’s\npatience came to an end one day when Yíwen set up an\nelectric guzheng* in the center of the room and began\nplaying it—or rather, began plucking its strings\ninexpertly to produce a series of dissonant, tuneless,\ntempoless sounds.  The interlude lasted a minute, after\nwhich Yíwen sat down and scribbled on some papers.  But then\nshe rose and repeated the performance.\n\nAfter the tenth iteration, Hwídah hurled a sandal\nright into Yíwen’s backside, causing the girl to yelp and\nturn around.\n\n“What,” growled Hwídah, “are you doing?”\n\nSome of Yíwen’s papers fluttered to the floor.  Hwídah\nsnatched them up.  They were printouts of quicksort\nimplemented in different languages: C, Lisp, Perl, even\nProlog.  Each was covered with musical\nnotations in red ink.\n\n“A thousand pardons for my rudeness,” said Yíwen.  “I have\nbeen attempting to encode certain algorithms as\nmovements through space, or notes in the air.\nIf the result is not pleasing I change my encoding and\ntry again.”\n\n“Why?” asked Hwídah.\n\n“To see what I will discover by doing it,” answered Yíwen.\n“We speak often of the beauty or elegance of code.  Perhaps,\nwithout knowing it, we have been composing choreographies\nfor information to dance to, and we find certain ones\npleasing because they appeal to some deeper aesthetic sense\ncommon to other forms of human art.  If so, then these arts\nwould be connected.  I seek that connection.”\n\nHwídah considered this.\n\n“Thus far, the music of quicksort eludes me,” continued\nYíwen with a sigh.  “Perhaps my experiment is as foolish as\ntranslating songs into code and attempting to\ncompile it.  Perhaps the music of quicksort is best\nplayed by machines for their own appreciation, and not ours.\nShall I quit this endeavor, and spare your nerves?”\n\nIn answer, Hwídah produced two bits of cotton from her\nnightstand and put them in her ears.

The most\ndramatic reduction had been in the number of Data Transfer\nObject classes.\n\n“I retained only those classes which map directly to\ndatabase tables,” Djishin explained proudly.  “See, here is\na query which joins the Campaign, Soldier, and Specialty\ntables, fetching but two columns from each.  Previously\nthere was a DTO whose only purpose was to return the six\nvalues for each row—shameful!  Now the query returns a\nlist of Campaign instances, each holding a list of Soldiers,\neach in turn holding a list of Specialties.  True, the\npresentation layer must now traverse these objects, but they\nare common throughout the application and will be familiar\nto all who labor upon it.”\n\nBanzen stroked his beard.  “You have adopted the ways of\nthe Object-Relational Mapping, in a framework of your own\ndevising.  I am acquainted with the virtues of this\napproach, but also with its vices.  These three tables have\nabout twenty columns each; the domain objects which mirror\nthem have likewise twenty fields.  So now instead of fetching\nsix columns per row, are you fetching sixty?  Or executing the\nquery in three passes?  Or employing some sort of cache?”\n\n“None of these,” said Djishin with satisfaction.  “I fetch\nonly the original six columns, plus primary keys.  All other\nfields in the domain objects are simply left uninitialized.”\n\nBanzen sighed and reached for his staff.\n\n\n\nDjishin awoke outside with a pounding headache, covered by a\nblanket of new-fallen snow.

We wrap\nthe function up, we bind the Real World down; we pass it in,\nshake it, and pull it back out, and that’s what it’s all\nabout.”\n\n“And this inscription, this is code?” asked Djishin,\nwondering at the monolith.\n\nThe nuns looked at each other.  “Someday all will know it as\nsuch, as readily as 20 GOTO 10.  But answer this\nquestion: are you a software engineer?”\n\n“I am no longer certain,” answered Djishin, whose confusion was complete.\n\nAt which point the young monk was enlightened.\n\nQi’s commentary\n\nIronically, the Monad always has at least one side-effect:\nit makes me feel like an idiot.\n\nQi’s poem\n\nThe screen darkens. \nSemicolons scatter to the four corners of the window. \nA storm may beat the high hill down—\nYet when the world changes, storms yield to a greater enigma."

The monk\nwas fetched by two Temple guards to explain himself to the\nAbbess.\n\nAs the guards marched the miserable monk up the tower\nstairs, they passed old master Banzen on the landing.\nTaking pity on the boy, the master whispered into the monk’s\near: “If you speak in your own defense, the Abbess will\nthink you a coward and cut off your head.  But if you do not\nspeak in your own defense, she will think you were\nresponsible for the incident, and cut off your head.”\n\nWith those words, Banzen departed down the stairs.\n\n\n\nThe monk was called into the office of the Abbess, who unsheathed a sword and demanded: “Explain how you brought disgrace to our Temple.”\n\nThe monk began to profess his innocence, but remembering the advice of master Banzen, he quickly shut his mouth lest the Abbess behead him for cowardice.  Yet the silence that followed only made the Abbess resolute in her anger.  She raised her sword and approached the terrified boy, determined to behead him for his undisputed incompetence.\n\nIn desperation the monk’s eyes searched the room for another exit, but they found only a screen of rice paper and bamboo, beyond which lay a narrow balcony and a hundred-foot plummet to the rocks below.  As the whistling blade fell toward his neck, the monk was enlightened.\n\n\n\nThe monk dove under the Abbess’ blade, rolled across the room, and stood before the rice paper screen.  Taking a red marker from his robe, he hastily drew a stick figure in one panel.  The Abbess paused, intrigued.\n\nIn the next panel, and in the ones following, the monk drew shaky cartoons depicting the events that had occurred over the past few weeks, and how his clan had reacted to each.  When taken individually, no step was in error.  Yet when taken collectively, it was clear that a confluence of unrelated actions had resulted in the critical vulnerability.\n\nThe Abbess sheathed her sword, and with a wave of her hand dismissed the monk.\n\nBut when the monk reached her doorway, the Abbess gave him a swift kick in the behind, sending him tumbling down the long tower stairs.\n\n“That,” said the Abbess, “is for writing on my walls.”\n\nEditor’s note\n\nThis case was written specifically for my recent talk\n“Hacking the mind: How Art can help us to talk (and teach) technology“.\nI had a great time presenting the talk at\nABB DevDay 2014 in Krakow, Poland.\n\nThe case is an homage to Kyogen’s\n“Man-Up-a-Tree”,\nwhich is Case 5 of “The Gateless Gate”.\n\nI promise to return to the much geekier stuff next week.  :-)"

Yet telecommuting did not\ninsulate her from the ongoing dramas of Temple life,\nand it was not long before the senior monk Wangohan began to bombard her with complaints about his longtime adversary,\nthe monk Landhwa.\n\nWangohan messaged:\n\n      We were each given a new application to develop, \n      using the framework I introduced to the temple... \n\n      I have written numerous unit and functional tests; \n      Landhwa has written none, and he swallows exceptions \n      to avoid vomiting them on the screen...\n\n      I validate all input on the server-side; \n      Landhwa depends on Javascript to sanitize his data, \n      though his trickery can be disabled on any client... \n\n      I generate simple, standards-compliant HTML; \n      Landhwa stitches together slick JQuery plug-ins, \n      trusting the browser to render his mess...\n\n      We demoed our systems this morning. \n      All the customer’s praise unjustly went to Landhwa. \n      None went to me.\n\nZjing reflected on Wangohan’s tendency to poison those who\nirritated him.*  To save Landhwa an unpleasant night\non the bathroom floor, she replied:\n\n      Send me the URLs for both your systems.  \n      I shall investigate.\n\n\n\nThe following day, Wangohan received a parcel from the nun\ncontaining two boxes.  The first, a box of fine black\nlacquer, held a lunch that was the picture of supreme\naesthetic harmony: eight tiny compartments in which were\nlaid sauces, sizzling meat, and vegetables all evenly cut,\narrayed around a square bowl of steaming rice garnished with\nflowers of appetizing hues.  The second, a plain white box\nof oily cardboard, appeared to hold the same ingredients—yet the portions were chopped raggedly and tossed together\nwith tepid rice in a most unappealing manner.\n\nOn the parcel a note was written in Zjing’s hand:\n\n     Choose and eat. \n     At the bottom lies your answer.\n\nWangohan devoured the contents of the box of black lacquer,\nbut was puzzled to find no further note at the bottom.\nHe was debating whether he was hungry enough to eat the\ncontents of the second box when a sharp pain in his gut\ndrove this thought (and all others) from his mind.\n\n\n\nThe following night, Wangohan—still bedridden—received another parcel from the nun.  This he opened with some\ntrepidation.\n\nInside were four small boxes of mint tea (their original\nwax seals intact), three articles on UI design principles,\ntwo thumb drives with the latest AngularJS and Bootstrap\ndistributions, and the following note:\n\n         This was the meal that Landhwa prepared: \n         treacherous in the stomach, true, \n         yet pleasing to the senses beforehand. \n\n         While Wangohan serves honest fare \n         that would have sustained us on a day-long march, \n         had we but desired it.\n\n         The presentation is not part of the food, \n         yet it is part of the meal; \n         our introduction, our interface.\n\n         Embrace its purpose, and remember: \n         the chef does not carve carrots into dragons, \n         to improve their taste.\n\n\n* See cases 84 and 120.

This means that in order to display our uptime in seconds right before rebooting the Universe, we would need time_t to have (3.32e56 + 30) bits.

  "Title": "The Summer Scarf",
  "Text": "Summer’s first week had arrived with pleasant warm winds, so\nmost of the Temple now took their meals and meditation\noutdoors.  But Yíwen the Artist, who loved open spaces,\ncould not be found anywhere on the Temple grounds.  Her\nroommate, the nun Hwídah, chose to investigate.\n\nShe finally found Yíwen weaving silently in one of the Temple’s\nvacant rooms, a diligent spider toiling at center\nof an immense web of fine gray yarn.  Its hundreds of cords\nwere being drawn from skeins scattered high and low around\nthe room.  Yíwen appeared to be making a scarf from all of\nthem at once.\n\n“Winter is six months away,” said Hwídah.  “Explain.”\n\nYíwen strummed her hand gently across the cords.  “Each\nshade of gray maps to a distinct whole number, in order of\nvalue.  For zero I have chosen a color named ‘The Blackness\nBefore Time’. Thirty-one is ‘Charcoal Smudge’, sixty-three\nis ‘Looming Thunderhead’, and so on, lighter and lighter, to\ntwo-hundred-fifty-five: ‘Celestial Cloud White’.\n\n“An impressive palette for such a modest seasonal\naccessory,” said Hwídah.\n\nYíwen held up the scarf in her lap.  “This is no mere\ngarment.  The pattern represents the evolving states of an\narray of numbers as they are sorted.  Each row represents\none step in the process, with its columns depicting the\nnumbers themselves.  See: at this end the gray\ncords are in a salt-and-pepper jumble, but with each row\nthey grow progressively more orderly as the algorithm tells\nme which cords to swap.  The final row’s columns will run\nsmoothly from black to white.”\n\n“Yet I also see one thin glittering gold thread, and another\nlike ruby” said Hwídah.\n\nYíwen indicated a portion of the scarf with her fingernail.\n“If the current step compares two elements, I place\nknots of gold around the corresponding cords.  If it selects\na pivot value, I embellish that cord with ruby.  Thus the scarf\nwill have exactly as many rows as the sorting algorithm has\noperations, and the aesthetics of the algorithm will be\nrevealed to the eye.”\n\n“You are still seeking beauty in code,” said\nHwídah.\n\n“A thousand pardons, Hwídah, but that is not my sole\npurpose,” said Yíwen.  “Are you, I wonder, familiar with the\nnovice monk recently brought onto my team?  His first task\nwas to ensure that a result set was ordered for display.\nYet he was ignorant of the built-in sorting utility,\nso he implemented his own.”\n\n“A most unfortunate waste of time,” said Hwídah.\n\n“Your words are surprisingly apropos,” said Yíwen.  “For he chose\nBubblesort,\nas we discovered in production when the application was given a\nvery large result set and took several minutes to render the page.”\n\n“You appear to be using Bubblesort as the basis for your\npattern,” said Hwídah, squinting at the finished rows.\n\n“Indeed!” said Yíwen.  “I have already completed a scarf using the built-in\nTimsort algorithm.\nIt is about one-fourth of a meter wide by two meters long,\nand I will enjoy wearing it.  This Bubblesort scarf is a gift\nfor the monk.  It will have the same width, but it will\nbe somewhat more... ungainly.”\n\n“It will be sixty-four meters long!” exclaimed Hwídah.\n\n“Now you understand why I must begin in June,” said\nYíwen.  “As you observed, winter is only six months away.”\n\n“And what will happen if the monk refuses to wear your\ngenerous gift?” asked Hwídah.\n\n“The same as if he fails to correct his ignorance,” said Yíwen.\nShe rolled the scarf into a thin tube and yanked the ends\nto show its strength.  “Sixty-four meters makes for a\nclumsy scarf, but an excellent noose.”"

  "Title": "What Lies Beneath",
  "Text": "Though previously inseparable, the roommates Yíwen and\nHwídah now only crossed paths occasionally, for Yíwen’s\nspare hours were occupied with the making of a\npeculiar scarf.  So the restless Hwídah had taken\nto exploring those few parts of the Temple grounds still unknown\nto her.\n\nHer wanderings led her to the halls of the abbey where\ndwelled the Clan of the Wolf's Bitter Breath, the\nblack-robed monks who performed all Temple’s integration\ntesting.  Developers were forbidden to trespass in this\nplace, though Hwídah had never been told why, and like all\nmysteries this one gnawed at her.  She lurked in the shadows\noutside doorways and below cubicle partitions, hoping to\nlearn some shocking Temple secret, but all she ever\noverheard from the black-robed monks within were loud jests\nat the expense of those developers whose code was defective.\nMost of these developers were of the Spider Clan,\nHwídah’s own.\n\n“It is most infuriating,” she heard one Bitter Breath monk\ncomplaining.  “I have selected an Order Status of ‘Unknown’,\nsubmitted the form, and all appears well.  Yet when I return\nto the form there is a validation error complaining of\nan illegal Order Status.  And the developer swears that he\nhas made no changes to this page!”\n\n“Thus is it always with the Spiders,” sighed another voice.\n“If anything comes too near, they wrap it in eight\nlayers of Javascript, cripple its responsiveness,\nsuck out its usefulness, and declare that the\ntwitching corpse is a job well done.”\n\nTheir laughter followed Hwídah as she crept towards the\nabbey door.  This, I shall surely investigate, she thought, her\nfists clenched.\n\n\n\nLater that day Hwídah approached Java master Banzen,\nwith the fire of righteous indignation in her eyes and a\nprintout in her hands.\n\n“This defect was created by a monk of the\nElephant's Footprint Clan, not ours.  He rewrote the\nmethod which turns each database row into an object, and his\nnew code contains this...”  Here she stabbed her finger at a\nline which read:\n\n    order.setStatusCode(rs.getInt(STATUS_CODE));\n\n\n“Ah,” said Banzen.  “I have seen such errors many times\nbefore.  The statusCode property is Integer-valued to allow\nit to hold a null.  But in the JDBC API, getInt returns the\nprimitive int type and silently coerces a database NULL to a\nzero.  This zero is silently autoboxed by\nsetStatusCode and returned by getStatusCode\nwhen the form is populated.\nAnd since there is no Order Status of zero,\na valid database row will appear to be invalid.”\n\n“What correction for the monk of Elephant’s Footprint?”\nasked Hwídah.\n\n“Nothing lethal,” said Banzen.  “My usual punishment\ninvolves a boat which I keep in the south gorge for just\nsuch an occasion.  The monk will emerge bruised and damp,\nand in the future he will examine his oars and his\nAPIs a little more critically before using them.”\n\nHwídah’s face turned scarlet.  “But what of the honor of\nSpider Clan?  The monks of the Wolf’s Bitter Breath\nmock us openly in their abbey because of this!”  Then she froze,\nrealizing that she had revealed her trespass\nonto forbidden ground, but Banzen only sighed.\n\n“The true fault lies with the authors of the venerable JDBC\nAPI, and with every maintainer since,” said the master.\n“They gave the monk a well-used rowboat, with sturdy oars\nalready mounted in the oarlocks.  Shall we doom him merely\nfor not noticing that the left oar was too short?  No... the\ndunking he receives when the boat spins in the rapids will\nsuffice.”\n\nHwídah bit her lip, bowed respectfully, and turned to leave.\n\n“Little nun,” said Banzen, raising his index finger to stop\nher.  “The defect is not mine, and I cannot prevent the\nerrors it engenders.  Thus I use both defect and error to serve\na greater purpose.”\n\n\n\nAt the evening meal Yíwen was not to be found, but\nHwídah spied Banzen’s two young apprentices,\nDjishin and Satou, sitting together.  The pair\nagreed to hear her complaints against their master.\n\n“Banzen seems determined to suffer this same error being\nmade until the end of time!” concluded Hwídah in\nexasperation.  “We should give the Elephant’s Footprint\na better boat!”\n\n“Indeed!” said Satou. “When I learned of this error, I\nbegged the master to switch to a popular ORM framework.  Yet\nrefactoring has its costs, and every tool has its perils,\nso the low-level code remains.”\n\n“Then we should provide a left oar of our own!” said Hwídah.\n\n“Indeed!” said Djishin. “When I learned of this error, I\nauthored a suitable getInteger utility method.  Yet\ndevelopers will only seek out what they think they need, and\nwhat they know to look for, so the utility goes unused.”\n\nHwídah sank in despair.  “So the monk of Elephant’s\nFootprint is barely corrected, and the monk of the Wolf’s\nBitter Breath is not corrected at all.  At least miserable\nHwídah has been corrected, for now I understand why it is\nforbidden to enter the Wolf’s Den, and that is to maintain\nharmony between our clans.  An insult can only become a\ngrievance if it is overheard.”\n\nDjishin said, “You perceive the shafts of the oars\nabove the water, but your true course has been determined\nby what lies beneath.”\n\nSatou continued, “Our master knows you violated the edict:\nthis much he has told us freely.  But the edict is not his,\nand he cannot prevent it from being violated by the irrepressibly\ncurious.  Thus he uses both the edict and its violations for\na greater purpose.”\n\nSatou put a companionable arm around Hwídah.  “Enjoy\nyour meal, sister of the Spider Clan!  For I fear that\nHwídah’s correction is just beginning...”"

  "Text": "The nun Hwídah was summoned to the offices of master\nBanzen.  She found the master waiting with his\napprentice Djishin in attendance.\n\nBanzen said, “A happy day for you, little nun!  Since you\ntake such pleasure in learning hidden truths and seeing\nguilty parties corrected, I have an entertaining task for you.”\n\n“I serve at the pleasure of the Temple, not my own,” Hwídah\nreplied with a dutiful bow.  But her stomach was already\nclenched; for no doubt this was the start of her\npunishment for trespassing on forbidden Temple ground.\n\n“An infrequent but stubborn error has plagued the\nElephant's Footprint Clan for some time now,” said the\nmaster as he handed the nun a printout.  “Our database logs\nshow this malformed SQL query, yet a thorough\nsearch of our code base reveals no such query anywhere.\nFind the source.  I give you one week.”\n\nHwídah studied the paper.  “A few minutes should suffice.\nMay I borrow the master’s terminal?”\n\nBanzen’s eyebrows shot up.  He exchanged glances with his\napprentice, then slid his laptop toward the nun.\n\nHwídah consulted the printout, typed something, scrutinized\nthe screen, consulted the printout again, and so on several\ntimes over.  “There,” she said finally, turning the screen\naround.  The cursor was indeed hovering over a SQL fragment\nwith a missing right parenthesis.  “If I return to my\nworkstation, I can trace this code to its consumers and\nreproduce the error seen in the logs.  Then we may repair\nthe defect with confidence.”\n\n“Go,” said Banzen to Hwídah.\nTo his apprentice he said: “Observe.”\n\n\n\nAs the pair walked to Hwídah’s cubicle, Djishin whispered,\n“The speed of your diagnosis was surprising.”\n\n“A simple matter,” said Hwídah, handing the printout to the\nmonk.  “The malformed query begins with WHERE 1=1.\nThat has the stink of dynamically-generated SQL—for\nalthough the initial condition is trivial, its TRUE\nvalue allows a developer to append any number of\nreal conditions as simple AND clauses.  I have\nused this technique myself when implementing search forms\nwith optional fields.  Once I recognized it, I merely\nsearched our code for the individual AND clauses.”\n\n“You misunderstand me,” said Djishin.  “I was not surprised\nthat you were able to solve it immediately; I was\nsurprised that you did so despite being given a full week.\nThat has the stink of ambition—for although this initial\nproblem was trivial, your ready truthfulness\nnow allows my master to entrust you with any number of real\nproblems.”\n\nHwídah sighed.  “It is just as well.  If I had pretended\nthat this problem was difficult enough to merit days of\neffort, Banzen would have thought me either deceitful or\nincompetent.  Neither would sit well with me.  That is what\nhe truly wished to discover.”\n\nDjishin nodded.  “Sometimes a test serves a purpose\nbecause the answer is so obvious.”"

But if we were to work in such an\ninflexible fashion, the Emperor would surely drown us\nin our own Waterfalls.”\n\nKaimu asked the second monk: “What have you learned from the bridge-builder?”\n\nThe second monk said: “The frugality of a true engineer is\nan enviable thing.  But if we were to cling so hard to\nyesterday’s technology, the Web would not exist for another\nthousand years.”\n\nKaimu asked the third monk: “What have you learned from the bridge-builder?”\n\nThe third monk said: “The predictability of a true\nengineer’s world is an enviable thing.  But ours is a world\nalways in flux, where the laws of physics change weekly.  If\nwe did not quickly adapt to the unforeseen, the only\nforseeable event would be our own destruction.”\n\nThe first monk asked: “Master... what has the bridge-builder\nlearned from us?”\n\nSaid Kaimu: “Nothing yet.  But when I touch a lit candle to\nthe oil I sprinkled from my lantern during our crossing, he\nwill learn the reason to plan for the absurd, the virtue of\nrebuilding in stone, and the wisdom of not insulting your\ncustomers.”"

Through webcams, phone and IM she had maintained\nan effective telepresence in the Temple.\n\nSo it was with some trepidation that she received this email\nfrom master Banzen on the evening of the longest night\nof winter:\n\n  An important Temple matter has arisen, and I desire your\n  confidential input.\n\n  My schedule has an opening tomorrow when the dawn bell is struck.\n  We may converse electronically if you so desire, but I would prefer\n  to speak in person in my office.\n\n  B.\n\nIn darkness Zjing dutifully ascended the first of the steep\nstairs that had been hewn out of the mountain walls.  Higher\nand higher she climbed, trying hard not to let her gaze fall\nto the wintry foothills below.  Snowdrifts blocked her path;\nshe scrambled over them.  Rope bridges creaked underfoot;\nshe crossed them.  Great moonlit icicles trembled overhead,\ntall as trees, sharp as spears, threatening to fall at the\nslightest whisper; she edged past them without a sound.\nHowling winds threatened to tear her off the foot-wide path\nand return her to the valley quickly and permanently; she\nclung to the rock face and forced herself to continue,\nhand-hold by miserable hand-hold.\n\nAt the last echo of the dawn bell, Zjing appeared\nat Banzen’s door.  She bowed and entered, betraying no emotion.\n\nBanzen closed the door behind her.  “I have just heard from\nmaster Suku,” he said.  “Although she was to return to us\nthis winter, she has decided instead to remain in the\nFar Provinces.”\n\n“Does she no longer love our Temple?” asked Zjing.\n\n“It is because she loves our Temple that she will not\nreturn yet,” said the master.  “She has found her travels to\nbe surprisingly edifying, both for herself and her\napprentices.  True, they are weary and weathered, and the\ncomforts of home would be most welcome now.  But there is\nmuch more to teach and to learn.  If Suku extends her\ntravels, all will benefit greatly in the end.”\n\n“This past year has been most difficult for the Spider Clan without her guidance,” said Zjing.\n\n“Indeed,” agreed Banzen. “A replacement must be trained.\nAs a senior nun of that clan, I called you here to learn\nwho you would suggest.”\n\n“Can one train a monk to be a master?”\n\nBanzen chuckled.  “Did you think that I was born with this\ntitle?  In our Temple, master is not an honorific, but a\nverb disguised as an adjective.  The candidate becomes by\nlearning, and learns by doing.”\n\nZjing pondered the many senior monks she knew.\nAll had virtues to speak of, but vices as well.\n“What qualities are you most looking for in such a\ncandidate?” she asked at last.\n\n“The first quality is the same one that master Suku herself\nhas demonstrated,” said Banzen.  He walked over to his\nwindow and gazed across the gorge.  The thin light of dawn\nwas just now illuminating the last few zig-zags of the steep,\nterrible path up from the valley.  “The first quality is a\nwillingness to leave one’s comfort zone when duty calls.”"

The day was hot, and all four\ntravellers were parched.\n\n\n\n\n“Young monk”, said Suku to one of her novices.  “Fetch us\nsome water from the well at the foot of this hill, and I\nwill tell you of my youth in this place.”  When the monk had\ndone this, and all four had drunk their fill, Suku said:\n\n“In this town I was prenticed in C to a good master.  Our\nshop followed the coding standards he set down, yet always I\nfelt he allowed us too much creativity.  For freedom is like\nthe kama1: with it the skilled can reap a whole field in a\nday, but the clumsy can cut your head off.\n\n“Over time I devised an elegant set of design patterns for\nmy own use.  Ah, if I could but show you now the glorious\ncode I wrote!  Every constant, type, function and variable\nwas named according to its purpose.  Parameters were ordered\nfrom most complex type to least, and the fields of structs\nwere prefixed to facilitate the use of special macros I’d\ninvented.  Maintaining my own code became a true joy.\n\n“I refined this system until with great pride I was ready to\nshow it to my master.  I begged him to add my coding\nstandards to his own, that our whole shop would benefit.\n\n“My master declared to all that it was indeed the most\ncomplete design and implementation metholodology that he had\never seen, and if the whole shop followed my example we were\ncertain to produce code of unparalleled beauty, clarity, and\nextensibility.\n\n“He gave me the name Enro2 and rewarded me with the\nhonor of laying a new path in our meditation\ngarden.  He designed this path to resemble a great winding\nserpent, with its tail grazing his garden gate and its jaws\nclosing around a well at the bottom of the grounds.  It\ntook me a month to dig the bed, level the bottom with sand,\nlay the paving stones, and set them well with gravel and\nearth.\n\n“When I finished my master said that the path, like my code,\nwas a thing of sublime beauty, and decreed that his shop\nwould keep it forever.”\n\nAt this Suku fell silent for a long time.\n\nEventually one of her novices asked: “Is the path still\nthere?”\n\n“We are seated upon the tail right now,” said Suku.  “See,\nright here is my old master’s gate; his house lies just beyond.\nAnd the water we drank is from the well between the jaws.\nNote what is on the path, and what is not.”\n\nThe novices’ eyes followed the wriggling path up from the well\nas it swept a great meandering arc around the\nhillside.  Its stones were green with moss and beset with\nweeds.  Where the path disappeared through the gate they\nnoticed that it joined a second track of bare earth, where\nthe grass appeared to have been trampled so often that it\nceased to grow.  The dusty track ran straight from the gate\nto the well, marred only by a fresh set of sandal-prints\nthat went down, and then up, and ended at the feet of the\nyoung monk who had fetched their water.\n\n\n1 A farming implement like a scythe, also used as a weapon.\n2 “Garden-path”."

  "Text": "The nun Yíwen was tuning a guqin in her quarters when her\nroommate Hwídah returned and slumped into a chair, visibly\ndefeated.\n\n“Ten thousand pardons for my curiosity,” said Yíwen, “but\nyour brow is more deeply-furrowed than usual.  Have you\nagain been investigating failures in our production\nsystems?”\n\n“It is all I seem to do these days,” sighed Hwídah. “Although the\ncause of this evening’s trouble was particularly irksome.\nEvery choice the developer made is optimal when taken by\nitself, yet the combination taken as a whole is disastrous.\nThus the best approach to fixing the problem remains elusive.”\n\n“How unfortunate!” said Yíwen.  “Have you informed the\ndeveloper of this conundrum, that they might meditate upon\nit?”\n\n“There was no need,” said Hwídah.  “This miserable soul is she.”\n\n\n\nFor a while the two sat in silence, as Hwídah took solace in\nsweet fragments of melody being plucked out by Yíwen.\n\n“The act of coding shares much with the composition of music,”\nobserved Hwídah.  “Each note may be perfect in isolation, yet it\ncannot be judged by itself.  It must be weighed against the notes\nthat come before, and the ones that come after, like steps in an\nalgorithm.”\n\n“Yet each must also be weighed against the notes sounded alongside\nit, would you not agree?” asked Yíwen.  “Melody and harmony are the\nwarp and weft of music; for the staff is two-dimensional, and\ntime is but one axis.  Even in my humble guqin, the vibration\nof one string causes its fellows to vibrate in sympathy, as\nsurely as multiple threads may affect each other in an application.”\n\n“Would that the harmonies of software were as simple as those of\nsound!” said Hwídah.  “For I did ‘play’ my application many times in\nprivate, and never a note seemed out of place!”\n\n“Simple?” asked Yíwen.  “Have you never heard of the Twelfth Root?”\n\n\n\n“Long ago,” said Yiwen, “it was observed that if a string is\nplucked along with another string exactly one-half its\nlength, the two notes sound so similar as to be judged\nidentical.  It was also observed that if a string is plucked\nalongside another which is two-thirds its length, the\nresulting harmony is quite pleasing.  The same held true for\nmany simple ratios, like three-fourths and four-fifths, and\ntwo-fifths, and so on.  Thus did a musical scale take shape\naround simple fractions.\n\n“Yet all attempts to produce a perfect scale for the\nkeyboard were thwarted.  For there are many such fractions,\nand many ways to arrange them, yet no matter which tuning\nwas tried it would always contain some intolerable imperfection.\nAn interval that sounded exquisite in one key would\nhowl like a wolf\nin another.\n\n“Every choice is optimal when taken by itself, yet the\ncombination is disastrous,” murmured Hwídah.  “But then\nhow is your keyboard tuned?”\n\n“By the best bad compromise of all,” said Yíwen.  “There are\ntwelve notes per octave, so the ratio of each note to the\npreceding is the twelfth root of two.  For although that\nis a most irrational ratio, it ensures that twelve\nidentical steps upward will bring us exactly one octave\nabove our starting place.\n\n“In this temperament, no interval is an integer ratio\nexcept the octave: they are all the slightest bit sharp or\nflat.  Yet it allows us to transpose songs into any key\nwithout distortion or dissonance.  In this way perfection yields\nto pragmatism... for though the harmony of the pasture\nis disturbed when we gird it with a fence, to do otherwise\nwould be to let the wolf in.”"

You should have an AddressDAO for\nquerying the Address table, fronted by a Service method.\nThe billing address should be obtained directly from there.”\n\n“But we have lost the Way of Object-Orientation!” shouted the\nfirst.  “Have we come full circle back to the days of C?\nOur Value Objects are little more than structs, our\nstateless DAOs and Services are merely collections of\nrelated functions, and we pass around integer IDs instead of\nthe objects they represent!  Shall we next run about\non all fours and bay at the moon?”\n\n\n\nWow... a roundhouse kick right to the copy constructor.\n\n\n\n“The Way of Enterprise Design Patterns is an advancement\ntowards ideal simplicity, not a regression to the\nprimitive!” said the second.  “A domain object is not\nintended to work as its namesake, any more than a picture of\na shovel is meant to dig a ditch!  You must set aside\nappearances and focus on purpose!”\n\n“Purpose is inherent in the name chosen!” said the first.\n“Domain objects should model the real world!”\n\nThe second monk responded with a fist to the first monk’s\nstomach, doubling him up.  “Tell me,” said the second monk,\n“in which instance variable did I hit you?”\n\nThe first monk leapt forward and boxed his opponent’s ears.\n“And here I thought those appendanges were for listening!”\nsaid the first, as the second staggered aside in pain.\n“How fortunate that I set aside appearances and discovered\ntheir true purpose!”  His gloating was cut short by an uppercut\nto the jaw.\n\nA young nun—a novice—noticed that several of the Java\nmasters were at the edge of the crowd, silently watching the\nproceedings.  She ran to them.\n\n“The two monks will kill each other before long!” said the\nnovice.  “Why do you not settle their dispute and tell us\nwhich philosophy is superior?”\n\nThe masters ignored her.  But the nun Zjing heard, and whispered to the novice:\n\n“If I were the monk who prefers the Way of Enterprise Design\nPatterns, I would say that you have committed the same error\nas the ditch-digger.  There is a question to be settled, but\nyou have mistaken the purposes of those present.”\n\n“Are you saying that the masters intend to conceal the\nanswer from us?” asked the novice.\n\n“Wú,” said Zjing.  “If I were the monk who prefers the Way\nof Object-Orientation, I would call your attention to the\nUnwritten Hierarchy, in which Master is but a\nsubclass of Student.”"

Hidden\namong its thick well-tended groves were four shrines,\ndedicated to four different gods of silence.\n\nThe monk Huisheng was paying his respects to the least\nof these when a sandal fell from the sky onto the ground\nbefore it.  The monk looked up and discovered a learnèd\nbrother—bound, gagged, and hoisted by ropes to dangle\nfrom the upper limbs of a cypress tree.  The prisoner was\nfrantically struggling against his bonds to attract\nHuisheng’s attention.\n\n\n\n\nIt was the habit of Huisheng not to speak\nunless spoken to; and since the prisoner was indisposed\nto speak at all, Huisheng merely turned away again and knelt at\nthe shrine, the better to contemplate the scene.\n\n—I have heard much today, thought Huisheng,\nconcerning the state of a critical nightly batch job.\n\n—Many praised the design of the job; for it was said\nthat if any record could not be processed, a suitable email\nwas sent automatically to the Administrator and to all\nParties Concerned.\n\n—Many admired the reliability of the job, and how it was\ncommon for days to pass with no such message being sent.\n\n—Many remarked upon the reticence of the job, and how\nit sent messages only when it deemed there was some error in\nneed of correction.  This trait I find particularly\nvirtuous, yet the abbot taking tea beside me spoke of it in\ntones of lament...\n\nHuisheng’s thoughts were broken by the sound of muffled cries\nfrom above.  Irritated, he cupped his hands over his ears.\n\n—The Protocols tell us of no fewer than Four Silences:\nthe Silence Before Words, the Silence Between Words, the\nSilence of the Broken Pipe, and the Silence of Fallen\nParcels.  To the initiate they are as different as the\ncharacters for “end” and “not yet,” although the outsider\ncannot tell one from the other.*\n\nThe unintelligible cries grew louder.  Huisheng looked up to see\na snake slithering along the ropes toward the terrified\nprisoner.\n\n—It is curious, reflected Huisheng.  The brother\nabove has not begged to be set free; nor has he entreated me\nto pitch stones at the snake.  Soon he will be dead.  Then\nhe will continue to not-ask me these things, albeit in a\ndifferent way.  If I leave this place, he will not-ask\nme in a different way altogether.\n\n—There is a lesson here in this monk’s correction,\nthough I have not yet divined what it is.\n\nThus, whistling a tune, did Huisheng depart the shrine.\n\n\n* 末 and 未."

When the abbot was also seated the master\nunpacked his lunch from a paper sack and began eating.  The\nabbot waited silently, with ever-waning patience.\n\n\n\n\nFinally the master finished the last bite of his meal.  He\ncrumpled up the paper sack and threw it at the waste bin in\nthe corner of the room.  The ball missed the rim by a good\nthree feet, bounced off the wall, and rolled to a stop next\nto the bin.  Banzen went out.\n\nThe abbot followed, thinking: Banzen’s devotion to\nperfection is too much praised in the temple.  Still, the\nrising moon makes an excellent circle but a poor square.\n\nBanzen then bade the abbot to summon the monks of the north\nhall one by one.  Each monk was told to meet the master and\nthe abbot outside the selected conference room.  Each was\nalso instructed to bring printouts of all code he had\nauthored within the past thirty days.\n\nWhenever a monk appeared, Banzen said: “Give me your code\nlistings and wait in that room, for I have been asked to\ninvestigate you.”  Each monk entered the conference room as\nhe was told, whereupon Banzen closed the door, leaving the\nmonk in the room alone.  Banzen then placed the monk’s\npapers face-down on an ever-growing pile outside the room.\nWhen precisely five minutes had passed Banzen would open the\ndoor and enter, saying, “You have been investigated.”  The\nmonk would then be dismissed.\n\nThe abbot thought: Banzen’s moon is lost behind a cloud.\nStill, the night is not yet over.\n\nBanzen repeated this ritual for all twelve monks of the\nnorth hall.

  "Text": "After breakfast, a novice of the Spider Clan noticed a line\nof six monks leaving the temple with bucket-yokes on their\nshoulders and grim expressions on their faces.  A junior\nabbot followed close behind.  The monks trudged down an\novergrown stony path that wound down the hillside,\ndisappearing into a thicket of pines.\n\nThis same novice observed the monks clambering back up to\nthe temple after lunch.  Their buckets were now packed full\nof moist earth and stones, yet despite the heavy load every\nbrother was laughing and had a spring in his step.\n\n\n\n\nSo it went the following day, and the day after, and the day\nafter that, piquing the curiosity of the novice.  All six\nmonks bore the red waist-cloths of the Laughing Monkey Clan,\nso the novice went to that clan’s hall.  The abbot\nwas seated on the floor of the common room, preoccupied with\nbalancing an egg on its point.\n\n“What of the six monks, and the buckets of earth?” asked the novice.\n\n“They are being corrected,” said the abbot, “for their\nperilous mismanagement of a critical software module.”  He\nreached into a small bag of salt, put a pinch on the floor,\nset the egg on top, and gently blew the salt away from the\negg.  The egg toppled.  The abbot sighed, took another\npinch of salt and began again.\n\n“What flaw did they introduce?” asked the novice.\n\n“Mu,” said the abbot.  “They introduced no flaw.  Not\na line of code has been touched in many months.”\n\n“Then what flaw did they fail to correct?”\n\n“Mu,” repeated the abbot as the egg toppled again.\n“The module functions perfectly, and doubtless will continue\nto do so for many months more.”\n\nThe novice frowned.  “I do not see how something which is\nflawless and unchanging can be objectionable, or its\nmanagement called perilous.”\n\n“You, monk!” shouted a voice behind him.  The novice turned to\nfind Java master Banzen glaring at him.\n\n“Tomorrow, you join the line,” said Banzen.\n\n\n\n“The punishment is simple,” said the junior abbot as the\nnovice took up the yoke. “I’ll explain when we get to the\nhollow.”\n\nThe novice followed the six brothers down the stony\npath, with the junior abbot bringing up the rear behind him.\nThey proceeded through the deep forest in silence.\n\nEventually they came to a broad bright sunlit clearing.  In\nthe center a giant spire of rock thrust upward toward the\nheavens: it rose a full four storeys high, and was so wide\nthat if twenty men stood fingertip to fingertip they could\nbarely encircle it.\n\n“Is it not grand?” said the abbot.  “It has stood since\nthe beginning of time.”\n\nApproaching, the novice could see that the clearing had been\ndug away all around the spire, so that it was surrounded on\nall sides by a great empty moat.  Peeking above the moat’s\nedge was the top rung of a bamboo ladder.  Each monk\ndisappeared down the ladder in turn, re-emerging a long\ntime later drenched in sweat, with a full yoke and a broad\nsmile.\n\nFinally it was the novice’s turn.\n\nThe moat was several storeys deep.  As the novice climbed\nrung by rung down into the shadows he could see that the\nearth had been removed not just from around the spire, but\nfrom under its base as well.  The entire massive boulder was\nnow balanced precariously on a few yards of packed\nearth.\n\n“Crawl under the spire,” the abbot shouted down, “until you\nreach the mound of dirt below the center.  Fill your buckets\nfrom there.  And if I were you, I’d work slowly and try not\nto sneeze.”"

  "Text": "Two nuns were walking along a wooded trail not far from the\ntemple, when they discovered to their mutual inconvenience\nthat the path ended in a sudden drop down a steep-sided\nravine.  The bottom of the ravine lay over two hundred feet\nbelow them; the cliff on the opposite side was nearly the\nsame distance away.\n\n“I pray your patience, Hwídah,” said the first nun, “For my mind has been\novertaxed from memorizing too many APIs.  But was there not\na rope bridge across the chasm at this point?”\n\n“I believe you are not mistaken, Yíwen,” said the second nun.\n“As I recall it was a sturdy bridge, old and servicable, and\nindeed I had hoped that we would make use of it on our walk.”\n\n\n\nThe wind whistled.\n\n“Again, take pity on me, Hwídah, for my eyes are\nweak from coding in the small hours.  But does that\nnot appear to be the remains of the rope bridge on the far\nside of the chasm, dangling down the cliffside?”\n\n\n\n\n“I believe it is, Yíwen, and if you look to the two great\ntrees on either side of our path you will see that a portion\nof the bridge dangles uselessly down our side of the chasm as\nwell.  Notice how both halves, near and far, twist in the wind\nwith a few meager footplanks still trapped here and there in\nthe braids, banging fitfully against the rock face.  The\nsound calls to mind a wind chime that once hung outside my\nwindow...”\n\n\n\nBoth nuns paused to consider the knocking and scraping of\nthe planks against the cliffside.\n\n“A hundred pardons, Hwídah, for my ears are used to little but\nthe clattering of my keyboard.  But can you not also discern\na voice upon the wind?”\n\n“I believe I can, Yíwen.  If you observe the ropes on the\nfar side you will realize that Zjing, a much-celebrated\nnun of our own order, is clinging to the end and shouting in\nour direction.  My impression is that she would be waving to\nattract our attention if her hands were not engaged in\narresting her fall.  Let us not forget our manners.”\n\n\n\nHwídah waved to the imperiled nun.  Yíwen did likewise.\n\n“I hope you will not think me unkind, Hwídah, but have you\nnot found Zjing to be overmuch concerned with the aesthetics\nof code?  Members of our clan complain that she frequently\nrefactors their modules merely because she believes the\nimplementation to be insufficiently elegant.”\n\n“I believe you are fair in your judgment, Yíwen.  While her\ngoals are laudable, they are ever at odds with the\ncomplexities of our problem domain.  Indeed, her efforts\nhave occasionally done more harm than good.  Still, that\nshould not affect our decision to come to her aid.”\n\n\n\nBoth nuns lingered at the cliff edge and reflected\non how best to help their comrade.\n\n“Is it not bad fortune, Hwídah, that the breaking of the\nbridge has left us with no means to cross the chasm\nand effect a rescue?”\n\n“I believe it is most terrible, Yíwen, but if the bridge had\ntruly broken then the ropes would be frayed, yet I can\nsee the finished ends quite clearly.  As I recall there was\na lovely painted gate of red and gold at the exact midpoint\nof this bridge, and each half was secured to the gate by\nknots which have somehow come undone.”\n\n\n\nHwídah pointed to the river far below, where the\nremains of the gate could be seen floating in an eddy.\nYíwen nodded.\n\n“Is it not your recollection, Hwídah, that the knots which\nsecured the ropes to that gate were lamentably large and\nugly, and detracted from its beauty?”\n\n“I believe they were, Yíwen.  I expect that their ugliness\nwould have been most tantalizing to one who cared about such\nthings—though it seems unlikely that anyone would be\nfoolhardy enough to attempt re-tying the knots while\nstanding at the bridge’s center.  Speaking for myself, I\nnever found the ugliness that troubling.  I was grateful\nmerely to be able to cross the bridge.  Month in and month \nout, it fulfilled its purpose most excellently.”"

So when one of their order was discovered\nto be dangling precariously by ropes halfway down a cliff,\nYíwen and Hwídah went together to\nseek the counsel of the abbot of the\nElephant's Footprint Clan.\n\nThe abbot listened to the nuns’ account with his feet\npropped up on his desk, polishing his spectacles with the\nfringe of his robe.  When the nuns finished the abbot\npulled a battered electronic tablet out from under a sheaf\nof papers and launched an abacus program.  Fingers poised\nabove the glass, he asked:\n\n\n\n\n“Hours required?”\n\nThere was an uncomfortable pause.\n\n“A hundred pardons, sir,” said Yíwen.  “But are you\nasking us to estimate the effort of the rescue first?”\n\n“I believe that is his function,” said Hwídah, “for I have\nheard him ask the same question of anyone who proposes\nchanges to our software.”  She fixed her eyes on the abbot.\n“A dozen monks and nuns, working for two days, should be\nsufficient to re-cross the chasm, haul up the remains of the\nbridge, and retrieve the unfortunate nun hanging off the\nend.”\n\n“I cannot release so many from their duties,” said the\nabbot.  “Proposals with a high level of effort require\napproval by the planning committee.  Come back in three\nweeks.”\n\nThe nuns exchanged glances.\n\n“A hundred more pardons for my insolence, sir,” said Yíwen.\n“But in the interim, what shall we do about the imperiled nun?”\n\n“Fling cooked fish and water-skins across the ravine,” said\nthe abbot.  “Some of it is bound to fly within her grasp.”\n\n“I believe,” said Hwídah carefully and with evident irritation,\n“that to perform this activity a scant three\ntimes a day would waste many good fish and water-skins, as\nwell as increasing the workload on the kitchen staff, the\nwater carriers, the fishers, the tanners, and—of course—whoever is tasked to stand at the edge of the chasm and\nhurl comestibles until they find their target.  The\ncumulative cost in salmon alone is likely to far exceed\nthat of a timely rescue.”\n\nThe abbot smiled sadly.  “When foraging for honey, the bear\nwill happily endure a bee sting every morning of his long\nlife.  But he cannot survive a thousand stings if they come\nall at once.”\n\nWhen the nuns had left the abbot’s office, Yíwen asked:\n\n“Does the abbot not know that it is the principal function\nof bears to eat bees, and not flee from them?\n\nTo which Hwídah replied:\n\n“Even so, the bear that cannot tell the difference between a\ndozen bees and a thousand will perish from fear in a\nforest dripping with sugar.”"

In the days following a release the sound of their\nfootsteps sent so many monks scurrying that the Clan was\nforced to go barefoot, delivering their defect tickets by\nstealth in the darkest hour of night.\n\nSo it was with some irritation that Java master Banzen—who prized correctness above all—was forced to account\nfor the repeated failures of the earnest monk Djishin.\n\n\n\nMaster Banzen sent for Djishin, who found the master watching\nthe sunset by the cliffside.\n\nSaid Banzen: “The monks of the Wolf’s Bitter Breath wish to\nknow if the next iteration of the system is worthy of their\nattention.

The plants will surely be uprooted\nby my weight.”\n\nBanzen produced an ocarina from his robe and blew a high\nchittering trill.  From the forest on the other side of\nthe chasm bounded dozens upon dozens of squirrels.  One by one\nthey leaped on the swaying cord and scurried across the\ndivide.

Yet he found himself so beleaguered by challenges\nfrom the Drowning Temple that he nearly walked out in frustration.\nTo make matters worse, some of novices of the Drowning\nTemple had apparently contracted his unique pollen allergy.\n\n\n\nThat night, Suku quietly asked the eldest apprentice what he\nhad learned from the novices.\n\nThe eldest apprentice made the ∅ sign of the\nempty-set on the moldy floorboards, fell back on his mat,\nand closed his eyes.\n\nSuku whacked him on the nose and repeated her question to\nthe others.\n\nThe second apprentice answered, “Our eldest knows how to\nchastise, but not how to convince.”\n\nThe third apprentice answered, “Our eldest wishes to make\nothers accept, but has failed to first make them reject.”\n\n“Excellent,” said Suku.  “Some of us have learned, so our\nFee has been paid.”\n\nShe grabbed the index finger of the eldest apprentice,\nsaying to him: “You speak to your peers as if they were\nempty registers waiting to be filled with the bits of your\nwisdom.  Ours may be a dry digital world, but it is built\natop wetware, which is squishy and irrational and prone to\noverheating.  You cannot flip a brain from zero to one\nsimply by praising the one.  You must start at the zero,\nextoll its virtues, explore its faults, exhort your\nlisteners to look beyond it.  To weigh the zero against\nthe one, the listener must have both in mind together.  Only\nwhen they have freely chosen the one will they abandon the\nzero.”\n\nStill holding the index finger of the eldest apprentice, Suku slowly\ndrew a zero on the floorboards and a one across its center.\nConsidering the symbol anew, the eldest was corrected."

So I’ll\ndo my best to stay clean out of your way, lest I trip you up\nand we both find ourselves muzzle-down in the mud.”\n\n“That is... good news,” said Zjing.\n\nMadame Jinyu added, “Ruh Cheen is not only new to our Temple,\nbut new to software development as well.  His previous\nposition was managing a team of fish skinners.”\n\n“That is... less-good news,” said Zjing.\n\n“To me, a java is something you drink, and a tomcat\nis something you pet,” said Ruh Cheen with a smile.  “So\nI’ll be depending on you to teach me the ins and outs of\nwhatever it is we do here.”\n\n“That is... wow,” said Zjing, finding herself at a loss for\na suitable adjective.  “If you will both excuse me, I shall\ninform the Spider Clan of this... news.”\n\n\n\nZjing called her monks in to a private conference.\nTheir astonishment turned quickly to fear.\n\n“How can this abbot hope to manage what he does not even\nunderstand?” asked one.\n\n“How can old Jinyu have hired him?” demanded another.\n\n“Truly she wishes to punish us for having dispatched our\nother abbots!” cried a third.\n\n“If only we could have but one of them back, to save us from\nimpending disaster!” lamented a fourth.\n\nThe hubub grew until Zjing called for silence.\n\n“Madame Jinyu is no fool,” she said.  “And it is not in her\nbest interests to set us up for failure.

He arrived early and eager each morning,\nseldom leaving his cubicle except for sleep.  He had even\nbeen observed chatting amiably with the monk Landhwa,\nwhom he despised.\n\nBut in the past few weeks Wangohan’s demeanor had changed.\nHe still arrived early and stayed late, but now he spoke to\nno one.

Wading through the alien syntax, she learned that the\nuser interface was coded with an AJAX-JSON-XPath framework\nwell beyond the capabilities of the Temple’s junior\ndevelopers; the templating language made Perl4 look\ncivilized and quaint; and the persistence layer was a\nNoSQL database so experimental that the release number\nbegan with two zeroes and ended in the words ‘alpha’ and\n‘SNAPSHOT’.\n\nI have investigated, thought Zjing.

Sometimes the\napplication hung, sometimes it ran out of memory.  Having no\none in the Temple to turn to, he had resorted to message\nboards, mailing lists, untried patches, and wild guesses.\n\nZjing excused herself, left her little hut, and spent the\nrest of the morning leaning on a low fence overlooking a\npasture, thinking.\n\nEventually some cattle appeared on the other side of the\nfence, shuffling in her direction.

See how they edge away as I approach!  Sometimes\nI walk to their right to keep them from the forest,\nsometimes I walk to their left to keep them from the ditch,\nand sometimes I walk behind to keep them from turning\naround.

Do not return\nuntil your eyes can see.”\n\nYoung Banzen obeyed.  He remained on the shoreline for days,\nwalking many ri back and forth.  There he spied women\nfishing in the tide pools with bamboo rods, and men weaving\nnets, and children playing in the sand.\n\nIt was the children that drew Banzen’s interest the most.\nAs the morning tide went out they gathered at the margin of\nthe receding waters, piling bucketfuls of wet sand into huge\nmounds while sorting out the shells and pebbles.  With each\nhour the water grew more distant, yet still the boys hauled\nbrine-heavy buckets up the beach to moisten the sand\nwhile the girls set to work on the summits of the piles.  As\nthe sun swung past its zenith a mighty fortress took shape,\ntop to bottom, some bits sculpted or patted by hand but most\nof it carved with the help of old knives and broken rice\npaddles.  The children lined the rooftops with tiny white\nshells, used chopsticks to poke out shadowy windows, pressed\nthousands of pebbles into the foundations, and dripped wet\nsand from their fingertips to make tiny conifers in the\nminiature gardens, one by one.  By this time the tide would\nbe creeping back up the shore.\n\nWhenever Banzen saw the first wave strike the battlements he\nalways winced; when the first delicate terrace crumbled his\nstomach always sank with pity.  Yet the children cheered.\nThroughout the late afternoon they watched hand-in-hand as\nthe sea reclaimed what had been taken from it, until all\nthat remained of the day’s labor was a great undulating\nlump of sand dotted with shells.  Then the children would\nleave.\n\nBut without fail they would gather the next\nmorning with their buckets and shovels, ready to begin anew.\n\nAfter a week Banzen returned to his monastery, enlightened."

No error is reported.  No error is logged.\nThe browser is sent to the ‘User Profile’ page as expected.\nYet this page sometimes shows the old address instead of\nthe new.”\n\n“A swallowed exception, most likely,” said Hwídah, wishing to\nbe somewhere else.\n\n“There is more,” said the master, shaking his head.  “If the\n‘User Profile’ is then reloaded repeatedly, it will\nsometimes show the old address and sometimes the new.\nNo pattern can be discerned.”\n\n“A caching problem, then,” suggested the nun.\n\n“There is still more,” said the master.  “After several\nminutes have passed, only one of the two addresses will be\nshown forever after.  But again, it is sometimes the old\naddress and sometimes the new.”\n\n“I am out of guesses,” sighed Hwídah. “A curse, perhaps, or\nan evil spirit.”\n\nBawan slapped her forehead.  “I have no patience for country\nsuperstitions, nun!” he said, turning to depart.  “There is\nno magic.  And the only evil spirits in this room\nare the ones you will witness tomorrow, if I learn that\nBanzen's chosen pupil cannot be relied upon.”\n\n\n\nThe nun called up the troublesome page, and found that all\nwas as the master described.\n\n“Most curious,” Hwídah said to the screen.  “Your face says\nsometimes this, and sometimes that.  Yet what is in your\nheart, I wonder?”\n\nThe nun logged directly into the database, observing the\nrecord each time she changed it.  But what she found made\neven less sense: for although the screen alternated randomly\nbetween the old address and the new, the database showed the\nold address steadily.  Yet after a few minutes both would\nagree on either the old or new record forevermore.\n\n“There is no magic,” Hwídah repeated.  “Every behavior,\nno matter how odd, has some rational explanation.”\n\n\n\n“...Yet I have no idea what that explanation is,” Hwídah\ncomplained to Yíwen.  “My only suspicion is that the\ntransaction does not commit properly, which is why the\nchanges do not appear when viewed from another database\nsession.”\n\n“A thousand pardons,” yawned Yíwen, who was still in bed,\nsquinting at Hwídah’s lantern.  “But my only suspicion is\nthat I was asleep moments ago, for it is after one in the\nmorning.  Is there no one else you may consult with?”\n\n“The courtyard is empty, as are my brains,” said Hwídah.\n“Help me think!  The Controller calls a Service method to\nsave the address.  The Service method is annotated as\ntransactional.  The method is invoked, yet chaos results.\nWhy?”\n\n“I know nothing about transaction management,” said Yíwen,\nfalling back on her pillow with closed eyes.  “I know only\nto put the annotations where they belong.  The rest is\nmagic.”\n\n“There is no magic,” Hwídah said absently.  Then like a\nbolt she was out the door, bounding for the courtyard.\n\n\n\n“When does a Service method commit a transaction?” asked\nHwídah with a broad smile.\n\n“At four-thirty in the morning?” said master Bawan testily;\nfor that was presently the time.\n\n“It doesn’t,” said the nun.  “The proxy object which\ndecorates the Service object does.  Now, when does that\nproxy object not do its job?”\n\n“This is another trick question, isn’t it?” asked Bawan.\n\n“When it isn’t used!” said Hwídah triumphantly.  “A mistake\nin the application’s configuration caused the Controller to\nbe injected with the Service object instead of its proxy.”\n\n“Interesting,” said Bawan.  “What of the page showing\nsometimes the old record and sometimes the new?”\n\n“Since there was no transaction,” said Hwídah, “the database\nupdate was performed without a commit, on a connection\nborrowed from the connection pool.  If a page happened to\nborrow that same connection it would show the new record.\nOtherwise it would show the old one.”\n\n“Intriguing,” said the master.  “And this behavior\nwould cease after a while, because...?”\n\n“If that connection is borrowed for some other\ntransaction elsewhere in the application, then either a\ncommit or a rollback will occur,” said Hwídah.  “And if it\ngoes unused for too long, we roll it back and close it.”\n\n“Excellent,” said the master.  “No evil spirits, then.\nNo magic.  Now go; get some sleep.”\n\n\n\nHwídah crept into her bed, taking care not to wake Yíwen.\nYet sleep did not come quickly to her.  Instead she lay\non folded arms, staring up into the darkness.\n\nWhat is magic, she wondered, but the achievement of things\nby hidden means?  Is the master of sleight-of-hand any less\na magician than the enslaver of spirits?  Is it not perhaps\nmore satisfying to peek behind the curtain, to understand\nthe intricate clockwork behind the facade, and to realize\nthat with that knowledge comes true power?\n\nHwídah was still pondering these things as she slipped, at\nlast, into a deep slumber, undisturbed by the stirring of\nthe Temple, the many ticks and tocks of the machine spinning\nup; water in the pipes, footsteps in the hall, gongs for\nbreakfast, for meditation, for the start of a new day, a day\nlike any other day, in this place of marvels."

Is it because he is fond of golden leaves and\ncrisp apples?  Or has he simply tired of warm afternoons?”\n\n“Let he who dreams of endless summer spend a year in the\ndesert,” replied the scribe.\n\n“And let he who fancies autumn spend a day among the birds\nand beasts,” said the senior monk, “for they know that\ncolder days are coming.  What is your plan for the winter of\nyour days, when your services are no longer required?\nEmigrate?  Hibernate?”\n\n“Innovate,” said the scribe.  “And if I can invent nothing,\nI shall reinvent myself.  Let mathematicians talk of\npi and e and i and phi.  The only constant of\nconsequence is delta-t, the Inconstant Constant, whose\nvalue no one knows, except that it always exceeds zero.”\n\n“Yet if you remain here, you must witness the death of all\nyou have created,” observed the senior monk.\n\nThe old scribe removed his spectacles to polish them.  “When\nthe last leaf has fallen, ask Shinpuru the gardener why he does not burn his rake for warmth.”"

  "Text": "Master Bawan posed this dilemma to the developers\nin his charge:\n\n“When investigating strange behavior in the production\nenvironment, our most powerful weapon has always been debug\nmessages: the more numerous and detailed, the better.  Yet\nwhen used copiously, the formatting of such messages becomes\nexpensive—needlessly expensive, for we exclude debug\nmessages from our logs when we are not \ninvestigating problems.  So which path is best?  Safe but\nslow, or heedless but fast?”\n\n“Wú,” said one of the nuns.  “Everything may be\nlogged, with minimal expense.  Wrap every debug call\nwithin an if statement which verifies that debugging is on\nbefore bothering to format the message.  We will only be\nslow when we need to be safe.”\n\nBawan considered this, and seemed pleased.\nHe bade the nun implement her approach in an application\nthat was presently being designed.  As further reward for\nher cleverness he presented her with two enamel boxes.\n\n“Open the red box immediately,” said Bawan, “but leave the\nblack box shut tight.  In time it will serve you.”\n\nInside the red box the nun discovered a small bowl full of\nsucculent kiwi fruit, lychee, and white pears, resting on a\nbed of goji berries.  These she enjoyed greatly that\nvery evening.  Afterwards she placed both boxes on a high\nshelf, and eventually forgot about them.\n\n\n\nTwo years later, after the system had undergone several\nenhancements, a minor production problem appeared—the first in many releases.  The nun requested that the\nsystem be restarted in debug mode.\n\nSuddenly, stack traces from NullPointerExceptions appeared\non the screens of every user.  The system had become completely\nunusable.  As the nun stood aghast amid the chaos,\nmaster Bawan sidled up to her and whispered, “Now fetch the\nblack box.”\n\nWhen the lid was lifted a foul odor issued forth.  Inside\nlay a small bowl filled with the mouldy, dessicated remains\nof what appeared to have once been kiwi fruit, lychee, pears and\ngoji berries.\n\nThe nun requested that debug mode be turned off\nand then closed the box, enlightened."

Some of\nit strides forward with purpose, but most simply follows\nwhat came before.  One monk’s IDE generates a poor method\nskeleton, a second monk copies the finished method\nthroughout the class, a third saves the class under a\ndifferent name for his own purposes...”\n\nThe nun found her way to the black-faced ram and stroked its\nbloodied ear.  “Your codebase is the errant sheep,” she\ncalled back to the senior monk.  “Correct it, and the\nlaziness of your monks will prove a great virtue.”"

Name any one and I’ve given\nit a go, be it fast or slow, high-level or low, from Ada to\nZeno.  But whatever the pluses there are minuses too, so I\npack my things and hit the road again—which in this case\nled me to your door.”\n\nKaimu asked the stranger to describe the language of\nhis heart’s desire.\n\n“It must be suitable enterprise-wide,” the stranger replied,\n“client-side and server-side, in scripting, in shells\nand in spreadsheet cells.  I need it real-time,\nmulti-threaded and optionally object-oriented; with garbage\ncollection, deadlock detection, custom exceptions,\nauto-resizing arrays of things and regular expressions for\nmatching strings.

Glumly\ncontemplating the dull day’s work that lay before him, the\nmonk had a sudden inspiration:\n\n\n\n\nI must produce a presentation-layer object to hold the\nparameters from the search form, he thought, as well\nas a service-layer object to represent each row returned by\nthe search.  Yet these both would have the same attributes\nas the RiceBag object we currently use for creating new\ntable rows.  Can I not simply reuse that database-layer\nobject for these other two purposes?\n\nWith growing excitement, he thought: If a database object\nwere suitably annotated, I could develop a framework which\nwould acquire the form input, validate it, convert it to\nSQL, query the table, and present the search results to the\nuser in tabular format... all requiring the most minimal\neffort on the part of the framework’s consumer!\n\nThe monk thus spent the next few days happily coding the framework,\nwith the RiceBag search page as its proof-of-concept.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the week Djishin proudly showed the fruits of\nhis labor to master Banzen.  The master studied the new\nframework, nodded, and ordered Djishin to convert seven\nexisting search pages in the application to use it, starting\nwith the Warrior page.\n\nAfter the monk ran off to comply, a nun who had been\nstanding nearby approached Banzen.\n\n“Master,” asked the nun, “The Warrior object has but a\nsingle Status value.  If the user’s query is represented by\na single Warrior, how could we ask for Warriors whose Status\nis either Missing, Retired, or Dead?”\n\n“We could not,” said Banzen.\n\n“Furthermore,” continued the nun, “The Warrior object\ncontains only information stored in the Warrior\ntable.  How could we find Warriors by the types of Weapons\nthey use, or by the Regiments they have served in, since\nthese require joining to child tables?”\n\n“We could not,” said Banzen.\n\nThe master took a small dark nugget from the jar he kept on\nhis desk, giving it to the puzzled nun.  “There once was a\nmonk who tired of rice.

I believe these are acceptable odds.”\n\nThe Java master congratulated his apprentice on her reasoning\nand bade her wait a few minutes while he fetched a suitable reward.\nBanzen returned with a box of assorted chocolates.\n\n“Take one,” he said.\n\nThe chocolates were indistinguishable, but they were laid out in neat\nrows and columns with a legend on the lid of the box.  Satou found\na square labeled Cherry and popped the corresponding\nchocolate in her mouth.\n\nHer expression changed from delight to confusion to horror, but\nshe was too late to stop herself from swallowing the confection.\n\n“That... wasn’t cherry...” she said, her pale face growing much paler.\n\n“Of course not!” laughed Banzen.\n“‘Cherry’ is only the name of the square it was in.\nThe contents of the chocolate are anyone’s guess.

Bawan\npointed to the four massive oak pillars that held up the\noldest part of the hall.  Scenes of temple life had\nbeen carved into each, on all four sides and stretching from\nfloor to distant ceiling.  The intricate figures possessed\nsuch astounding verisimilitude that the monk could almost\nhear the clacking of abaci.\n\n“These were fashioned two hundred years ago by a monk of our\norder,” said Bawan.  “It took him six years, laboring every\nnight with a hammer and chisel, his work lit only by the\nglow of a single flickering cathode tube.”\n\nFurther down they came to another square of four pillars,\nidentical to the first square in every way.\n\n“These were made a hundred years ago by monks of the\nHarmful Go-To Clan, which has since been banished,” said Bawan.\n“They replicated the originals with a bamboo pantograph secured to\nan electric router.  It took them six months, working by the\nlight of a discarded CRT running Anantha's Fountain.”\n\nFurther down they came to yet another square of four pillars,\neven more like the originals.\n\n“These were created fifty years ago by three nuns of the\nElephant's Footprint Clan, which tends our databases\nand secures our history,” said Bawan.  “The nuns traced\nthe contours of the originals and fed the coordinates\ninto a programmable milling machine.  The measuring\ntook six weeks; the carving a few days.”\n\nFinally they came to the new south portico, supported by a\nfinal square of pillars so like the first that the slightest\nstray chisel mark had been reproduced faithfully.\n\n“These were installed ten years ago by one of our summer\ninterns,” said Bawan.  “He photographed the originals with\nhigh resolution digital cameras, combined the data into a\nthree-dimensional topographic mesh with sub-millimeter\nresolution, and outsourced the manufacture to a mill in\nthe next province.  Six days, end to end.”\n\nBawan faced the initiate monk.  “Which set of pillars is of\ngreatest value to the Temple?”\n\nThe monk considered and said, “The ones that exist purely as\ndata gathered by the intern.  For though they have neither\nheight nor breadth nor weight, still from them all other\npillars could be remade.”\n\nBawan bowed and led the monk out.\n\n\n\nThat night Bawan walked alone by lantern light through the\nhardware archives of the Clan of Iron Bones, in the\ndeepest cellars under their abbey.  Finding at last the\nparticular VAX mainframe he sought, Bawan hooked up a dusty\nVT100 terminal, flipped on the power toggle, and opened a C\nsource file that had not been compiled for a quarter of a\ncentury.\n\nBawan noted with satisfaction how perfectly the statements\nhad been indented, how descriptive the function and variable\nnames were, how thoroughly each parameter had been\ncommented.  He smiled at a few TODO and FIXME comments: an\nappeal to a future that would never answer back.  Then he\nscrolled to the top where his own name and email address\nappeared proudly.\n\n“The initiate was only half-right,” said Bawan to the\nemptiness.  “True, the value lies not in carven oak, but\nneither does it lie in the shape of the carving; for both\nthe real pillar and the virtual one may be lost, and the\ntemple will be no poorer.

The monk cringed, expecting to\nfeel his life blood spilling inside his robe.  Instead\nthe knife only severed one strand of his hempen bonds.\n\n“Not perfect, but better,” said Suku, and went out.\n\nShe did likewise for one hundred evenings until the\nmonk was freed.\n\n\n\nAfterwards the monk meddled less with the code of his\nfellows, and instead began to pride himself on his ability to\nmimic the design patterns of others when modifying their\napplications.\n\n“It is still a truth of refactoring,” he now said, “that\nsometimes one must introduce chaos to bring order, just as\nthe road to the sea must sometimes scale a mountain before\nit turns downward again.  Yet order is not a destination:\nmerely a direction from complex to simple, from more\nto less.  The master asked for less but I thought only\nof one, and chose a path worthy of a\nhailstone\nwhen simple subtraction would have sufficed.”"

  "Title": "Spring, Fall",
  "Text": "On the Monday after the first budding of spring, the\nentire Temple was called to assembly in the Great Hall by\nold Madame Jinyu, the Abbess Over All Clans And Concerns.\nNot a single person was excused—indeed, two desperately ill\nmonks were carried in on stretchers and hoisted upright\nagainst the back wall, next to the propped-up corpse of a\nsenior nun who had died the previous Thursday without giving\nthe mandatory two weeks’ notice.\n\nDirectly in front of old Jinyu’s podium sat the diligent\nmonks of the Elephant's Footprint Clan, who together had\nmastered the arcane arts of database design and a hundred\npersistence libraries.  The monks had arrayed themselves in\nperfect rows and columns atop low ceremonial look-up tables\nthat had been joined together for the occasion.\n\nBehind the Elephant’s Footprint sat the knowledgable\nmonks of the Laughing Monkey Clan, who implemented the\nbusiness logic of the Temple’s many customers.  So frightfully\nintelligent was the behavior of their rule engines that\ntheir codebase was rumored to be possessed by the spirits of\nlong-dead business analysts.\n\nBehind the Laughing Monkey sat the prolific monks of the\nSpider Clan, who built the web interfaces and services\nof every Temple application.  Because web technology stacks\ncame and went so frequently, their novices were trained to\ninstinctively forget everything that was no longer relevant,\nlest they go mad.  Curiously, though, when asked how this\nArt of Forgetting worked, the monks invariably laughed and\nsaid that there was no such Art; for if there were, they\nwould surely have remembered learning it.\n\nProud were these, the Three Great Clans of the Temple.  So\nit was with great dismay that they learned of Jinyu’s plans\nfor their future.\n\n\n\n“In autumn, the abbot Ruh Cheen convinced us to taste\nthe nectar of the Agile methodology,” said old\nJinyu to her audience.  “Through the winter we nibbled its\nfruit and found it sweet.  Now spring has arrived, and we\nwish to plant the seeds of a great harvest.\n\n“No longer will we haphazardly select monks from the Three\nClans to work on tasks as they arise.  Instead, each product\nwill have a Tiny Clan of its own, whose members will not\nchange.\n\n“Some of you will belong to a single Tiny Clan; some to two\nor three.  Each Tiny Clan will have its own rules, set its own\nstandards, establish its own traditions.  The monks of your\nTiny Clans will be your new brethren.  You will work with\nthem, eat with them, do chores with them, and share a\nhall with them.\n\n“Tonight I will post your new assignments.  Tomorrow the\nThree Clans will be no more.  Now, go: prepare yourselves.”\n\nThus did old Jinyu depart the Great Hall, to a chorus of\nworried murmuring.  Even the dead senior nun seemed\na trifle unhappier.\n\n\n\nYoung master Zjing turned to old Banzen with a look that was equal parts dread and disbelief.\n\nSaid Zjing, “When the Spider learns her craft from the\nMonkey and the Elephant, what manner of webs shall we see in\nthe trees?”\n\n“Creative ones,” replied Banzen.\n\n“And how shall we manage such ‘creativity’?” continued the\nnun.  “How shall we review code?  How shall we mentor?  How\nshall we plan?”\n\n“Differently,” said Banzen.\n\n“You are infuriatingly calm!” scowled Zjing.  “I thought\nthat Banzen of all people would share my concerns.”\n\nBanzen chuckled.  “When Ruh Cheen was brought into the\ntemple by Jinyu, you told your fellows that\nthe abbess is no fool.  And though you were lying,\nyou spoke true.  Jinyu sees that the new Way of the World\nis not the Temple’s Way.  She has chosen to follow the World.”\n\n“She is following it over the edge of cliff,” grumbled\nthe nun.\n\n“Indeed!” said Banzen with a smile.  “Yet what is the\nTemple: a stone, or a bird?”  The old master took Zjing’s\narm in his own and started for the doors, nodding his head\nrespectfully as they passed the dead senior nun.  “I have\nlived through such times before.  The initial plunge is\nalways unsettling to the stomach, but we have yet to crash\ninto the rocks below.”\n\n“So, how long must I wait before I see the Temple\nsprout feathers?” asked Zjing.\n\n“My dear young master,” said Banzen.  “Did you not understand\nthe terms of your own promotion?  We are the feathers.”"

  "Text": "Winter had come to the Temple in full bitter force, so a\nnovice of the Clan of Iron Bones chose to spend his\nleave time visiting brethren in Phong Province to the\nsouth.  The monks of that place worked on the planes of a\ngreat render farm, where the directional light was\ngloriously warm regardless of the season.\n\nAll morning the novice watched as learned brothers scurried\nto and fro, planting random number seeds, building\nbounding-boxes, or wrapping wire frames around even the\ntiniest model so that its pixels would blossom in just the\nright places.  Thus were produced succulent scenes of\nevery shade and hue, to please the tastes of the Imperial Court.\n\nAs midday approached, the novice’s stomach began to rumble.\nSince he required an escort to venture into the temple\nproper, the novice approached a pleasant-looking boy\nabout his own age, who was rigging artificial light\nsources above a grove of small quadtrees.  The boy’s\nclothes were of a rough sturdy linen, yet as testament to the\nrigor of his duties the once-solid hues had been worn down\nto dithered bits, both knees were covered with\nbi-quadratic patches, and the right cuff showed signs of\naliasing.\n\n“Ten thousand pardons,” said the novice (feeling all the\nmore guilty for his own idleness) “but this miserable body\nwill gnaw at me until I feed it a bowl of rice.  Where is your\nmaster, that I may beg or barter with him?”\n\n“In his chambers, where very soon I must go to bring him his\nbowl,” said the boy.  “Walk with me as I fetch it and I will\nfill your own as well, for at this time of year\nour buffers are always full.”\n\nThe novice accepted a generous helping of rice, then\nfollowed the boy on his errand up the dim spiralling staircase\nwhich was the temple’s only hallway.  It was built thus, the\nboy explained, to baffle stray photons.\n\n“For glare is ever our enemy,” said the boy, pushing open\nthe door to his master’s chamber.  “Although there are greater\nperils, as my master could certainly tell you, if he\nwere here.”\n\nThe novice followed the boy inside, puzzled.  The high\nwindowless room was lit only by the diffuse glow of a\nmonitor on a solitary desk.  The surface of the wide monitor\ncould not be seen from this angle, but the glassy stare of\nthe motionless, drooling old man behind it made the novice’s\nhair stand on end as surely as if his scalp had commanded\nevery follicle to indicate its normal vector.\n\nThe boy slowly set the bowl down in front of his master,\nthen backed away, taking care to avert his eyes from the\nscreen.\n\n“He is lost,” explained the boy bitterly.  “You see, long\nago he devised an ingenious algorithm for rendering any\npart of the mandelblob in the wink of an eye...”\n\n“I have heard of this shape,” interrupted the novice,\nunable to tear his gaze from the master’s visage.  “Rumors,\nonly... a dread equation so small it may be inscribed on my\nlittle finger, yet describing a fractal sphere of infinite\ncomplexity.”\n\n“Not just a sphere,” continued the boy.  “A world; a\nworm-eaten world, implicit in the laws of number theory.\nPermeated by caves within caves within caves, their walls\nscarred by gaping chasms, yawning cracks and belching\ncrevices.  Pick any taffy-twisted tunnel, the smoothest you\nlike, and if you zoom in far enough you’ll find that the\nsurface wriggles and blisters and boils like putrid flesh on\nthe cusp of liquescence, sprouting flaccid stalagmites\na-crawl with mushrooms, mushrooms on mushrooms on mushrooms\ntoo tiny to be imagined, until they vanish into their own\nasymptotes, erupting on the other side as spores above\nspores above spores; and each spore is its own worm-eaten\nworld as infinitely complex as its progenitor, yet\nperversely different from it too...\n\n“My master had barely begun to explore this shape\nwhen by some accident he zoomed too deep into one\nparticular nanoscopic nodule, one random spore among\nbillions, and found—or so he claimed—that it was a\nverisimilitudinous image of our own world. Yes!\nMathematical mountains exactly where our mountains lie,\nbursting with needled protuberances like ferns or fir-trees—all the same sickly amber hue, like the virtual cumuloids\nthat hover above, and the simulated shorelines gritty with\npicoparticles of amber sand, where amber waves of graininess\nstand poised to break but never do; for this is a\nthree-dimensional world, and for want of fourth\nnothing moves, not even the people.  Yes, people!\nMonochromatic statues grotesque in face and form, yet human\ndown to the eyelash-hairs, to the pores in their nostrils,\nlike caves within caves...\n\n“But in his trembling haste to plumb the depths of this\nflyspeck world, my master clicked left instead of right.\nHis cursor jumped sideways and the crucial coordinates were lost\nforever.  I am told his howls of anguish could be heard\nin the surrounding hills.  Every monk of the temple rushed to\nthis chamber, frantic to learn what great disaster had befallen.\nAnd thus did he relate the tale of his discovery.\n\n“The other masters laughed at him, called him a liar or mad.\nEven monks of low station shunned him.  So he set out to\nclear his name by finding those fateful coordinates again.\n\n“Days became weeks, became months, became years, and now see\nwhat he is reduced to: a prisoner of the Unit Sphere,\nforever wandering while going nowhere, held captive by\nhis own obsession.  For a time, perhaps, he believed he had\nstumbled onto some Great Truth of the Universe, a calculable\ncorrespondence between the world of flesh and the one of\nfigures.  Now I cannot guess what landscapes he wanders, or\nwhy—nor would I wish to, lest I succumb to some\nirresistable fascination and so share his fate.  It is said\nthat fore-warned is fore-armed, but for me at least... I\nfear my mind.  When the real meets the imaginary, their\nproduct is always complex.”\n\nThe novice edged forward to peer around the edge of the\nscreen, but the boy stopped him.\n\n“Take your rice and leave this cursed place,” said the boy.\n“And bring this one truth back to your own temple: that the\nRender Farm of Phong Province is no better than a poppy\nfield, where daily we sow the doom of our people.”\n\n“I do not see,” said the novice.\n\n“The Emperor has but to name a pleasure—the thrill of\nbattle among the stars, the viewing of immodest persons\nengaged in lecherous activities—and we will serve it to\nhis private chambers in six million pixels of sixteen\nmillion colors at sixty frames a second.  But do not envy\nhim this.  Instead fear the day that you and I enjoy the\nsame liberty.  For though we have created an eternity of\nwonders here, none of us are given an eternity to explore\nthem.  How precious is time; and how empty, ultimately, is\nany world but our own.”"

  "Title": "Laziness",
  "Text": "The head monk of the Swooping Falcon Clan asked master\nBanzen for assistance with a difficult customer.  The\ncustomer was a maker of silk-and-bamboo kites, and the\nclan’s application allowed her to curate her large online\ncatalog.\n\n“I simply cannot make her happy,” complained the\nhead monk.\n\n“Tell me what makes her unhappy,” said Banzen.\n“Then perhaps you can do the opposite of that.”\n\n“Laziness,” the head monk declared; “for she says that our\ninterface makes her do too much work, yet the work\nis her fault, not ours.”\n\n“Explain,” said Banzen.\n\n“First,” the head monk said, “for each kite, she wishes to\nallow only certain silks.  So our interface must have her\nspecify the silks on a kite-by-kite basis—yet always she\nsays this task is too tedious.  It is not our fault that she\nis so particular!”\n\n“Indeed,” said Banzen.\n\n“To make matters worse,” the head monk said, “she has\nhundreds of bolts of silk in her shop, of which\ndozens may be offered for any given kite!  We have tried\nevery widget in our library—multiple-selection lists,\ndual listboxes, typeahead-enabled drop-downs—yet always\nshe says this task is too onerous.  It is not our fault that\nshe offers so many choices!”\n\n“Absolutely,” said Banzen.\n\n“Finally,” the head monk concluded, “new silks are always\nbeing introduced and old ones are always being retired.  So\nshe must revise the list of silks for each kite throughout\nthe year—yet always she says this task is too burdensome.\nIt is not our fault that fashion is fickle!”\n\n“Agreed,” said Banzen.\n\nSo Banzen went to see the kite-maker.\n\n\n\nThe kite-maker’s complaints were exactly as the head monk\ndescribed.  After hearing them, Banzen wandered her workshop,\nand indeed found many hundreds of bolts of silk, each\na different pattern and hue.\n\nAfter pondering a moment, Banzen pointed to the bamboo\nskeleton of a kite on her workbench.\n\n“What silks will you offer for that one?” asked Banzen.\n\n“Blue cloud designs only,” said the kite-maker.  “But I\nhave dozens of silks with blue cloud designs.”\n\n“And that one?” asked Banzen, pointing to another.\n\n“That is one of my ‘crow’ series,” said the kite-maker.\n“Blue feather designs or black feather designs, but no\nlightweight silks.”\n\n“And that one?” asked Banzen, pointing to another.\n\n“That is one of my ‘dragon’ series,” said the kite-maker.\n“Black solids, red fire designs, or white earth designs,\nbut no heavy silks.”\n\nWhen he was certain that he understood the kite-maker’s\nalgorithm, Banzen returned to the head monk.\n\n\n\n“It is as you described,” said Banzen to the head monk.\n“What makes the kite-maker unhappy is laziness.”\n\n“Yet how can she be corrected?” asked the monk.\n\n“Wú,” said Banzen, producing a thick envelope from his robes.\n“Here is the means of correction, which I will deliver\nto you each week until the kite-maker has achieved happiness.”\n\nIn one quick motion Banzen tossed the contents of the\nenvelope into the air.  Hundreds of minuscule squares of colored\npaper spiraled gently down around the room; each like a\ntiny kite adrift on the wind.\n\n“Lovely,” said the head monk, “but what is it?”\n\n“It is called confetti, said Banzen.  “I made it from your\nweek’s pay.  Using small bills, of course.”"

  "Title": "Unsupported Accusations",
  "Text": "While passing by the temple’s Support Desk, the nun\nHwídah heard of strange behavior in a certain\napplication.  Since she had been appointed by master\nBanzen to assist with production issues, the nun\ndutifully described the symptoms to the application’s senior\nmonk:\n\n“Occasionally a user will return to a record they had\npreviously edited, only to discover that some information is\nmissing,” said Hwídah.  “The behavior is not repeatable, and\nthe users confess that they may be imagining things.”\n\n“I have heard these reports,” said the senior monk.  “There is\nno bug in the code that I can see, nor can we reproduce the\nproblem in a lower environment.”\n\n“Still, it may be prudent to investigate further,” said the\nnun.\n\nThe monk sighed.  “We are all exceedingly busy.  Only a few\nusers have reported this issue, and even they doubt\nthemselves.  So far, all are content to simply re-enter the\n‘missing’ information and continue about their business.\nCan you offer me one shred of evidence that this is anything\nmore than user error?”\n\nThe nun shook her head, bowed, and departed.\n\n\n\nThat night, the senior monk was awoken from his sleep by a\nsqueaking under his bed, of the sort a mouse might make.\nThis sound continued throughout the night—sometimes in\none place, sometimes another, presumably as the intruder\nwandered about in search of food.  A sandal flung in the\ndirection of the sound resulted in immediate quiet, but\neventually the squeaking would begin again in a different\npart of the room.\n\n“This is doubtless some lesson that the meddlesome Hwídah\nwishes to teach me,” he complained to his fellows the next\nday, dark circles under his eyes.  “Yet I will not be\nbullied into chasing nonexistent bugs.  If the nun is so\nannoyed by the squeaking of our users, let her deal with\nit!”\n\nThe monk set mousetraps in the corners and equipped himself\nwith a pair of earplugs.  Thus he passed the next night, and\nthe night after, though his sleep was less restful than he\nwould have liked.\n\nOn the seventh night, the exhausted monk turned off the\nlight and fell hard upon his bed.  There was a loud CRACK\nand the monk found himself tumbling through space.  With a\nCRASH he bounced off his mattress and rolled onto a cold\nstone floor.  His bed had, apparently, fallen through the\nfloor into the basement.\n\nPerched high on a ladder—just outside the gaping hole in\nthe basement’s wooden ceiling—was the nun Hwídah, her\nface lit only by a single candle hanging nearby.  She\ndescended and dropped an old brace-and-bit hand drill into\nthe monk’s lap.  Then she crouched down next to his ear.\n\n“If you don’t understand it, it’s dangerous,” whispered the\nnun."

  "Text": "A general of the Imperial Army had commissioned the Temple\nto build a supply requisition system.  Mindful of cost, he\nsent an officer of the 3rd Unsigned Integer Division to\nreport on the Temple’s progress.\n\nThe officer noted with satisfaction that most of the\ndevelopers worked calmly and methodically: they drew up\ndetailed designs, submitted the documents for approval\nor amendment, and consulted the final drafts as they coded.\n\nYet one of the nuns did not.\n\nAs the officer watched, the nun created a dozen classes\nin the repository, stared at each for a moment, renamed half\nof them, stared again, broke some into pieces, stared, added\nsome methods and subtracted others, and so on.  She repeated\nthis throughout the day.\n\nThe officer could no longer contain his impatience, saying,\n“Enough!  If the Imperial sculptors were as impulsive\nas you, there would be no jade left in the world!”\n\nThe nun replied, “If the Imperial sculptors are foolish\nenough to carve roof tiles out of jade, the Emperor’s palace\nmust still be half-open to the sky.  Myself, I choose to\nwork in clay.”"
